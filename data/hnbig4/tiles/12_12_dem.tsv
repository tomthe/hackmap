I always found it an epic cop-out by the restaurants and cafés who refused to answer questions about their dishes or allow a simple additional request like adding more spicy. Invariably the restaurants with QR code menus were also the ones that featured pretentiously-named menu items so you had very little idea what it was going to be until after you ordered it. Fortunately while I lived in China (up through the early months of COVID) the vast majority of small restaurants still kept their classic red-and-yellow menu board that literally just says in the name of the dish exactly what you are going to get. And it was no problem to ask a question to clarify an ingredient or ask for something special.What I don't understand is if you're just	alisonatwork	8.483145	6.190199	comment	3.0	39.0	1667116055	13.266606

I went to a large private university of around thirty thousand. I'd estimate, on any given week, the average student has eaten leftover pizza in the morning once. This alone puts us at a hundred and twenty thousand overnight pizzas consumed per month. Millions per year. At just one university!  Surely we'd hear cautionary tales of overnight pizza at 1 in 100k or even 1 in a million, as deaths from it would be far more common than binge drinking.My estimates may be off a bit, but probably not by as much as you'd think. Student organizations buy copious amounts of pizza because it's popular and cheap.	grumple	8.364105	6.2500024	comment	3.0	12.0	1617127993	11.293551

Nothing has enough spices added, nothing is allowed to cook long enough, etc. Complexity and culinary sophistication is thrown out the window to make food-making look enticingly, deceptively simple and quick.

What Blue Apron delivers is not exactly convenience -- ordering takeout is a lot more convenient -- but the perception that you are doing something complicated and real and primal while you are actually, through the miracle of technology, doing something much easier.

Cooking, and browning. Cooking, that is, making them soft enough to eat, is what takes the most time. Most of the time when you use onions in a dish, they're browned first, then they finish cooking with the rest of the dish.But when you make caramelized onions by themselves, if you don't spend the time to cook them properly, they won't have the right texture, even if the flavor is close.

They also own vast tracts of very valuable land (especially in Lancaster, PA). Combine that with being frugal and austere, and it's a recipe for wealth.For childcare, their community focus let's them share the burden amongst the larger group. Additionally, children are not nearly as coddled and are expected to contribute to the family's work, and help co-parent their siblings.Compare this to the average nuclear family: underpaid, barely any savings, most likely rents, and lucky if they have even one family member nearby that can share the childcare burden.	hesdeadjim	8.122494	7.260224	comment	3.0	13.0	1626192581	-14.930264

This fits with my observation that it's the ""misfits"" who tend to leave.This includes my mother who left home as a teenager, moved to another country and never went home again.

Traditionally in Valencia, the paella was to be eaten only at lunch time and never at dinner time. This is because it's rice-based, so it's too heavy to go to sleep afterwards and dinner time is fairly late. But a lot of tourists want to eat it at night, so restaurants serve it anytime.

At least in Denmark where I live, you can get the same equivalent food (say a burger, fries and a soda) for half the price (if not even less) if you go to a supermarket and buy the stuff, and it will also be healthier (more good nutrients, less bad things). You can cut the cost even more if you decide to make everything from the ground up, and then it's even healthier than both the McDonalds and the supermarket alternatives.I can see how something like coffee or ice-cream could be an okay choice at McDonalds, but the ignores the fact that the coffee is bad and the ice-cream isn't very good either compared to what you can get in other places.McDonalds isn't ever a good choi	fredsir	8.319832	6.119412	comment	3.0	15.0	1507098436	11.391185

The telephone. Few places will collect your credit card information over the phone for a reservation.

One thing I found was that none of the official Keurig machines heat water to the optimal temperature for brewing coffee (around 195-205 F).There are a few third party brewers that will hit that level, but I’m very curious why Keurig itself doesn’t offer one. Maybe safety/liability?Also, whereas every Nespresso machine brews the pods basically the same, the Keurig machines vary widely in terms of brewing temperature, so you have to be careful which one you buy.Honestly, I started biased towards Keurig but came away with the conclusion that, if you really want capsule coffee, the only reasonable choice is Nespresso. The original Nespresso pods are an open ecosystem with third party pods so that would be my recommendation.	senkora	7.8391223	6.293409	comment	3.0	24.0	1701902056	-7.7005873

Most of their other equipment they have more than one choice for suppliers but not for the ice cream machine.  The supplier is Taylor, which supplies ice cream machines to many other restaurants which do not suffer from the same problem. The Taylor-made machine for McDonald's is deliberately designed to have a secret menu that only “authorized service personnel” are allowed to use and the main menu only throws obscure & unhelpful error messages and the Owner manual is not helpful at all.  This forces franchisee owners to pay thousands of dollars a year these service people to come and “fix” the issue with the machine.	fouc	8.334617	6.192748	comment	3.0	16.0	1619440268	-1.0769441

I think this can be true, but two points:1. The high-attrition low-skill workforce at fast food restaurants is a fact of the industry. (I am not endorsing it either.) So if a solution is failing widely when faced with the reality of its users, then the system is flawed not the users.Of course, you might argue that it’s impossible to build a system that works with this type of users, which leads to:2. The video argues that failure rates at competing fast food restaurants are vastly lower. While I can’t verify this myself, if we assume it’s true then it’s strong evidence that the problem here is unique to McDonalds and therefo	matthewdgreen	8.4535675	6.188332	comment	3.0	10.0	1619440219	2.6351566

Mostly because it allows me to see and get a feel for the workflow, the timings and such that are impossible to get across from just a recipe. Especially for baking videos have been great because when it says “should be tacky to the touch but not sticky” it’s always “how sticky is sticky, what is tacky, how do I know what it feels like etc” and seeing a baker doing it helps immensely. Once I’ve gotten a good grasp for the process though I far prefer using a recipe.	sondr3	8.243011	6.131918	comment	3.0	19.0	1623452121	11.451655

Which isn’t to say every franchise agreement is a good investment.Where things break down for MLM is really the specific business model and percentages involved.  If say 4% of a sales guy’s check gets sent to the chain of people who recruited him then no big deal.  However, large percentages or large buy can quickly become very problematic.

It makes a seal, and the seal prevents coffee from dripping out. It's like holding your finger over a straw.

It’s an equilibrium for the businesses and possibly for the workers, but often not for the customers. One of the strange things about tipping is they people usually still do it even when there’s no need to. It’s rational to tip at a neighborhood restaurant where they might remember you the next time around, but it’s conpletely irrational to tip for a one-off meal in a strange city or at an airport restaurant or whatever. Most of us tip anyway in those situations.	mikeash	8.529073	7.038182	comment	3.0	11.0	1549728163	-15.283772

Other businesses like Pret in London were already using a hybrid centralized preparation with small, hyperlocal retail sales model.If you want to make money, you can't think and do what everyone else is doing in all respects.	paypalcust83	8.595585	6.2908573	comment	3.0	19.0	1588372223	4.110369

The ones that don't will be sold off or parted out. And the cycle will continue.

Once they started doing food delivery it was a game changer. My food arrived hot enough that I had to wait sometimes but almost always pleasantly warm. To me, it’s worth paying the fees, especially since I don’t have to spend time going out, waiting, driving back. When I go for In’n’out these days, it’s almost an hour spent in total. I would rather pay fees and a tip to get someone to bring it to me.And quite honestly, without food delivery most of these restaurants would be dead anyway so they really should be thankful.

I suspect there's some trademark arguments to be made regarding confusion as to who is providing the product and service and whose failures any mistakes reflect. That kind of attribution, and the product quality it promotes, is one of the central purposes of trademark law. But there's also the first sale doctrine--that after you sell your physical product, people can do with it as they please, including resell. I suspect it comes down to how clear Doordash makes it that the restaurant is not involved in the service, but I'm not an expert in these areas, and this is obviously not legal advice.	throwaway_dflka	8.563132	6.3098025	comment	3.0	14.0	1589768001	4.013977

That argument doesn’t make sense.McDonald's doesn't make more off the ingredients of a day's sales of ice cream as it does off a service call, probably by a couple orders of magnitude. I'm not sure why you think it would.It would be most profitable for McDonald's if the machine went down every single day. The problem with that is the franchises would stop selling ice cream, not that they'd have to trade $25 of ice cream ingredient profit for the profit off a high priced service call that you can respond to with a low-paid, minimally trained tech with a computer that just decodes a mundane error that can be fixed in seconds. A tech can probably do 15 of those a day.	pessimizer	8.351621	6.1948004	comment	3.0	14.0	1630560837	-0.9954976

27898289	> Stop the tipping guilt trip placed	> Stop the tipping guilt trip placed on the public, raise your prices 20%, and pay your employees a livable wage.FYI, one of the reasons restaurants don't do this is the tax impacts. When someone tips 20%, there is no sales tax assessed on the tip — the full 20% goes to the worker. If you increase prices by 20%, that is subject to a sales tax (roughly 10% where I live), which amounts to a 1%-2% increase in the total price.On top of that, moving tips to wages results in more income and payroll taxes being taken out (most workers do not fully report all of their tips, which saves them both income and payroll taxes).It might not seem like a lot — just a couple percent here and there — but restaurants have pretty thin margins.	gnicholas	8.528333	7.0245733	comment	3.0	12.0	1626810088	-15.2934065

Hilton Head Island, SC is a great example of the trend that COVID accelerated.Hilton Head is a popular vacation destination, but as development started radiating inland towards I95, all of the workers are priced out. The housekeeper at the hotel I stayed at in 2019 commuted 2.5 hours daily, and restaurants started reducing hours due to labor shortages. COVID made it worse, but the problem existed because you can’t work in most places without covering the cost of operating a car.My understanding this year is that popular restaurants require reservations 60+ days in advance.There may be some demand shifts at the low end from sit down to fast casual, but those are the places where tipped workers are paid the least.

Then in both England and Germany, coffeehouses were seen as such places of disrepute that women were banned from going to them!On refrigerators, early refrigerators used ammonia, which was toxic if it leaked.

The food itself was good, nothing to rave about though. Concerningly though, when I went in around 2:30pm on Friday, I was one of the two customers there. The rest of the store was deserted.There's no cashiers, just a bunch of self serve iPad stands with an clerk walking around looking to see if I needed help.

To my knowledge we do not know how to process coffee in a way such that a machine can model and understand the human taste buds. And it certainly haven't been applied successfully to coffee brewing yet.	hvidgaard	7.7714415	6.265092	comment	3.0	18.0	1485870465	11.063729

For example, coming in at 330/4 to start prep for the dinner shift.When labor costs basically nothing, there's no reason not to overschedule them.This reduced the amount of time I could spend outside of work learning to program (for example... since it's what I did hah) or others could spend improving their skills for basically no money.

Are walk-ins just paying a premium for convenience? Is it actually more expensive or did they raise prices beyond the necessary point under the guise of inflation so they’d have headroom for later? Does your local place actually pay and treat workers worse?In my HCOL city, I’ve seen ads for McD workers with a $30+/hr salary. I don’t know if they’re overpaying compared to mom-and-pop stores to get workers, but it seems like a good thing to see even more incentives to eat at local restaurants instead of chains.	vineyardmike	8.368785	6.1206245	comment	3.0	11.0	1707360313	4.46187

The menu items themselves were not exotic (hummus, beet purée, pickled vegetables, ribeye, chicken kabobs), but the execution and complex cascades of flavors were on a whole new level of reality. The prices/portions are generous as well (e.g. $10 for the best hummus you’ve ever tasted, $50 for a cut of ribeye that would cost $30 at Whole Foods).	jointpdf	8.431275	6.200814	comment	3.0	10.0	1646074301	11.3748255

Everyone involved in this drama wants ice cream in the stores. It's not like McDonalds corporate has some Jobsian disgust towards putting ice cream and a burger in the same meal or anything. The far easier explanation is that McDonalds paid Taylor for a custom machine that's extremely temperamental, not that they secretly want to ban their own product because it's ice cream.	kmeisthax	8.312125	6.1637974	comment	3.0	17.0	1646235684	-1.1143799

But Kytch cofounders Nelson and O'Sullivan admit that doesn't explain why McDonald's would similarly seek to prevent a fix for its embarrassing—and expensive—ice cream machine failure rates.This is strange. Another comment mentioned how the existence of these broken ice-cream machines is anti-competitive towards businesses like Dairy Queen. Does this explain why the machines are always broken?

There's also ample evidence that software updates to Taylor's McDonalds machines have made the error codes more cryptic and the machines more unreliable over time.I think there's a pretty strong legal case to be made that these machines are deliberately designed to break down in order to drive repair service revenue for both Taylor and McDonalds at the expense of franchisees. Unfortunately, franchisees seem to be locked up under binding arbitration clauses in their franchise agreements. Luckily for consumers, 3rd party vendors aren't subject to these contracts.	chongli	8.345293	6.199162	comment	3.0	30.0	1646239643	-0.9479775

Especially with spirits and mixed drinks the corruption is obvious.

One of these things is not like the other ones.(As an Aussie, though, the tipping thing just seems weird. It's nice to tip a little for really good waitstaff, but if doing so means they get a pay cut on their hourly wage then that's bogus.

So you need like $120/day post-tax in order to just make rent (and 2-3x that to qualify for the lease in the first place). So let's say you need $300/day in tips to live here. (That works out to about 109.5k/year -- a respectable entry-level tech salary, but that would be just above the poverty line in SF if you were trying to support a family of four on it.)Suppose that you have a ramen restaurant that's only open for dinner, seats 29, always has a line out the door, has a cycle time of half an hour, is open for 6 hours a night, and has three servers. Assuming 100% of seats are full (let's say you're the best ramen place in town), that means that each server will get tips from 116 customer	cbhl	8.540943	6.9490304	comment	3.0	10.0	1529969599	-15.28645

In AU this is not hard to find, but there certainly are plenty of chain pizza restaurants that go for the heavy, piled-on, thick crust, 10 minutes to bake/boil.  I gather in the US there are regions where the latter (Chicago perhaps?) is the default, but I'm not sure how common the genuine Neapolitan style is - in availability or popularity.Anyway, to your list -- if toppings are flowing at all, you've got too many toppings.

When I worked at a franchised McDonald's as a teenager we were all jealous of the corporate McDonald's a few miles down the road as they had better pay, benefits, uniforms and everything just looked way cleaner there. At my franchised McDonald's we were told to do the bare minimum for _every single thing_ we did.I'm curious if there is any data on franchised versus non franchised restaurants and if there is a way to objectively compare them.

I live in France and just paid €15 for cheeseburger and fries at a local cafe in the south. Insane how expensive hamburgers are in France. $18.30 for a bistro cheeseburger! Pre-tax that is $14.66. Then take away the “service charge” and that’s $12 for a burger that is functionally equivalent to In and Out et al.	briandear	8.337671	6.1154714	comment	3.0	10.0	1516700360	11.427145

If that means tipping, because their employer--who you chose to do business with--doesn't pay them a livable wage, then guess what? You tip. If, at the same time and in no way exclusive to the former, you would like to campaign for better worker rights and wage floors that make tipping unnecessary (or, hell, even illegal), then I will join you in that.You might not like tipping. (Again: I don't.) The person you're rationalizing the stiffing of probably doesn't like having to work for tips. Capitalism kinda sucks and the person-to-person patching is something that more fortunate folks just plain get to do. Sorry.	eropple	8.533323	7.0432205	comment	3.0	16.0	1518157910	-15.290046

The next logical step is a $20 coffee.Meanwhile in Europe you can get a good espresso for a euro.	almostApatriot1	7.790776	6.2728887	comment	3.0	22.0	1518894577	4.733611

They drink a medium roast most of the time, although there are light roasts readily available. I have seen documentaries with Italian roasters from Illy and on down to smaller boutique roasters, who come to the US and just rip into the roasters for their crappy burnt coffee. These are their customers / business partners, but they just have to be honest to them about what they are serving.

And of course they aren’t getting paid any more to do maybe 3-4x the work they did before these apps got popular.In that world being paid per job seems better than making the same to do much more work.	tempsy	8.564531	6.304734	comment	3.0	19.0	1579226247	4.1259203

According to US labor law you can even pay servers less than minimum wage, as long as their tips make up for the difference.

This raises supply and the surge rate decreases. Drivers are distributed automatically where they are needed. Overall trips taken should be higher compared with a no surging model. So it shifts both the demand (higher ride price) and the supply curves dynamically. That’s an easier model to market to customers as there is at least some logical sense behind it.However in Wendys case dynamic pricing has no effect on supply. It just modifies the demand curve.Fundamentally they are betting that their food demand is inelastic enough that they’ll make more money overall.

39657105	The Amish aren't really about reject	The Amish aren't really about rejecting technology just to be luddites, but rather to about trying to preserve their traditions and culture. One of the ways they do that is to avoid adopting new things (technologies, processes, etc) until the community leadership agrees to it. There are Amish that have cars, electricity and computers because their communities have determined that those technologies are acceptable in certain situations and allowed them.Seen that way, electric bikes may not be a big change from the regular bikes some communities already allow for transportation. Appearance is a very significant part of Amish culture though, and changing those norms just to fit a technology is exactly what they don't want to do.

Prior to about 15 years ago, the basket for the grounds was almost always full separated by a compartment from the heating element and pumping area. Slowly, these areas were combined into one, with a plastic lid that covers both where the grounds are place for filtering, and the basin that water sits in. Maybe its a simpler design. Maybe.By combining the regions, steam builds up and small particles of coffee find their way into the water storage basin (inevitably). Because of this, the heating element and pumping area are exposed to small particles of coffee, which creates buildup, and can clog the elements. Thus, a modern coffee maker designed in this way *will* fail after a number of cycles. Th	RosanaAnaDana	7.8141294	6.295684	comment	3.0	22.0	1661916066	-7.7028537

The concept was amazing, but I’ve had one too many questionable people deliver my food that the last time it happened I didn’t even eat it.I’m a huge fan of the “1 million jobs” type of companies like this, but there’s a level of trust that comes with allowing someone to handle the food you eat. I’m not even a judgemental individual, and I hate people that are, but I shouldn’t feel uncomfortable about my food delivery. I now go get my own food. Oh well.	traviswingo	8.632305	6.4585414	comment	3.0	12.0	1519921860	-15.0638275
16493763	DoorDash doesn't mark up menu prices	"DoorDash doesn't mark up menu prices any more, at least in my market. Supposedly restaurants didnt like the hidden markup, so they moved all of their fees into the delivery fee and the service fee.Its not terribly fair to consider taxes and tip as ""hidden charges"", IMO. The taxes you pay even if you go to the restaurant yourself, and the tip is the majority of what the drivers get paid -- they dont work for free. I'd prefer a flat driver's fee, though, its not twice as much  work for someone to deliver $50 of food vs $25, so I generally don't make large orders on DoorDash."	ac29	8.608009	6.4407835	comment	3.0	12.0	1519923766	-15.069125

As a bachelor I loved them until I found out these companies use multiple ways to add up charges. Most of the time restaurant cost in-shop vs cost app varies a lot. Then they charge some kind of ""packing charges"". Including delivery fee some times the delivery price is 25% more than restaurant prices.When I talked to some of the restaurants, they said these guys can take up to 30% of the food cost. It means DoorDash et al, can take up to 50% of an order.So, I find it surprising that these guys still struggle to become profitable.I also think that this whole phenomena might actually end up pushing restaurant prices up to the detriment of consumers."	thisisit	8.63423	6.4533877	comment	3.0	10.0	1519923132	-15.066505

I really wish they would do better pre-planning with ingredients, like send a stick of butter and a jug of vinegar instead of a pat and a tiny bottle.

We ended up just using a lot of the techniques we learned from Blue Apron to prepare vegetables from CSA boxes.It's a great idea for young people who would like to learn how to cook (or learn some new techniques/staples).

It's already a percent, no need to adjust for inflation.I love seeing college kids tip 25% at food trucks with their clover iPad or square terminal.  First of all, there is no waiter or service, and secondly, the options presented are 18%, 20%, and 25% or something equally stupid.  I'm always fascinated that these kids with no income have no problem hitting the 25% button...for nothing.	lotsofpulp	8.539618	7.0291924	comment	3.0	10.0	1520454898	-15.288938

If you've ever been to Camden Market in London, there's loads of food vendors, and they all do this, they have examples of whatever they are making just sitting there, so you don't even need a menu - just point at the thing that you want and they will make it for you. I think it's the same with these - a roll in itself probably won't attract interest, but display it cut in half so everyone can see straight away what you're selling and it becomes a lot more attractive."	gambiting	8.448009	6.11475	comment	3.0	11.0	1605606208	11.28305

The article fails to mention the fact that tipping actually creates an environment where more prejudice (not less) can be exposed. If you aren't a stereotypical ""good-looking"" female server, you will statistically earn far fewer tips. The same goes for people working in the kitchen (as the article mentions).If your servers (or anyone working in the restaurant) demand higher wages, pay them the fair wage and charge what it costs to operate at that level. The expectation of a tip feels similar to the hidden fees charged by wireless carriers so they can advertise a much lower rate."	curiousgeorgio	8.528988	7.0283575	comment	3.0	47.0	1606057067	-15.288783

So, I guess the question is—are your actions to not tip waiters coordinated with a movement of other people with the goal of achieving change?

There was never anything to be upset about in the first place. Regardless the outcome. If someone messes up your order you just say “Looks like we have the wrong order. We ordered X”. There is zero requirement of being polite or impolite unless your goal is to manipulate the situation for your own gain.For example if you are trying to get your meal for free now or something else they did not immediately offer.

Cast iron is really forgiving of seasoning, you don’t need the perfect job to cook with it.However, cast iron will never be as non-stick as a good non-stick pan, and if you treat it as one, you’re going to have a bad time.Put bacon in a dry, hot pan, and it’ll leave crispy fond stuck to the pan. (Nothing you do will ever create fond in a non-stick pan.) Cook bacon starting with a cold pan, and enough fat will render by the time it heats to keep it from sticking.Eggs will stick to cold, dry cast iron.

28991191	I think you misunderstand Amish phil	I think you misunderstand Amish philosophy. Contrary to popular belief, the Amish did not decide one day in the 18th century that technology had gone “far enough” and that they were going to freeze in time, their way of life at that moment, forever.Instead, they saw the way changing technology began to accelerate the pace of life in society around them. In response, they adopted a philosophy to preserve what they believed were the most important things in life.Accordingly, their philosophy is based on one simple rule: they will not adopt any technology they deem a threat to the time they spend with family and with God. Look at any “modern” family, with teenagers staring at their phones instead of talking to each other at the dinner table, and it’s easy to see that the Amish may be on to so	chongli	8.139463	7.270702	comment	3.0	15.0	1635185594	-14.942701

I could ""just not tip,"" but that mostly harms the people who have the least power in the situation (the waiter) rather than the people who can change it (management).Instead, I feel like the only ethical option available to me is to preferentially frequent no-tip restaurants.  Unfortunately there aren't too many of those and although I hate the tip system, quality of food is usually more important except at the margins.It seems like the sort of thing where maybe there's a regulatory answer, but I'm hard-pressed to think of one.

23486083	When you order through a delivery se	When you order through a delivery service, the restaurant is generally paid less than their normal menu price, and none of the tips go to the kitchen staff.In addition to charging the restaurant, the delivery service charges the customer a higher price than the restaurant would. They add delivery fees and service fees.  On top of that, the online menus in the delivery service apps often have higher prices than the restaurant’s “real” menu.Restaurants often negotiate special deals with the delivery services, so all these details can vary.  However, delivery app margins are much lower than carry out or dine in margins.	hedora	8.591774	6.3892655	comment	3.0	15.0	1591860275	-15.046093

If you don't tip a Lyft driver, they aren't going to give you a dirty look or treat you any differently, especially since you get to rate them on their service.You can complain that people should be paid a fair wage, but they aren't. I wish for many things, such as the end of warfare, but I accept the current reality that I live in and that I don't care enough about tipping to dedicate time and energy to affect its change. I'm not going to go out of my way to change some business's wage policy. It's sub-optimal, but what isn't? Humans are terrible at setting the correct prices for goods and services.

I have seen a novel (to me at least) system when visiting Boston, a city of traffic jams:People wearing a metal contraption on their backs that makes them look like ghostbusters.  In one hand is a hose from which they can fill your cup; on the other side is a tube of paper cups if you don’t have one.  They just walk through the traffic jam (I saw this at the end of the tunnel leading to East Boston) and driver would wind down their windows.On one hand your scheme has much less labor, but this approach can serve many more, and captive, customers at  a high density time of day.	gumby	7.8811297	6.289041	comment	3.0	11.0	1675961228	4.576147

For light roasts brew hot, almost boiling. For dark, brew a little cooler, maybe 88-90 degrees. Evenness is really the key. Now depending on your method you can do all sorts of rituals whether it's using some super thin needles to rake your coffee in your portafilter to remove clumps (WDT) or pouring careful concentric circles into your V60. But the easiest answer is to eliminate the variable by brewing with immersion.

You've now dirtied 2 spoons, the container, and the press, so you gotta clean those. If you made too much for a single cup the rest will get cold and also too bitter. All of the batch will be silty if you're not careful.I just like the taste of an americano better, and I can make one in about 30 seconds, and dirty no dishes other than the coffee cup.The pour over is better than the press but still, you're futzing with the filter holder, using a filter, pouring over for a few minutes, and I just like espresso.	joshlemer	7.7870545	6.301252	comment	3.0	13.0	1677301140	-7.7272677

We Italians are used to that (you could say we don't know better), and dislike any variation from the norm, so that doesn't bother most people; in actual coffee countries you have places that do care about coffee quality and experiment with single-origin, different roasts, etc. In Italy these places are a tiny minority, and for the rest is the same burnt expresso everywhere (and, if you're unlucky, very acid).It might be different in big cities like Milan, but I dou"	gattilorenz	7.7846475	6.284527	comment	3.0	16.0	1692282491	4.7532887

It's really basic and doesn't make good edutaninment content.I'd say 90% of being a competent chef is just down to knowing how to balance the basic flavor components; and to figure out how these things change during the cooking process.With practice and experimentation you can learn to infer what is lacking by taste and make anything go from bland to amazing.Spices and ingredients are much less important.  They aren't unimportant, but they aren't what makes something decent into something great.

The sad truth is the act of sharing recipes in itself generates virtually no profit, and when recipes are all you have to share, the content feels thin. So they have to pad it with lifestyle blogs and ads.Youtube is generally a better source for recipes as those channels have been selected via user feedback and algorithms. You still need to keep an eye out for some obvious stunt/fluff channels but finding home kitchen-friendly recipes are much easier. Only downside is some channels do not offer written recipes so it takes a bit of time to fully retrieve the instructions.	ssnistfajen	8.228453	6.125041	comment	3.0	13.0	1687449795	11.437155

If you walk into a kitchen where an assistant has line up all the ingredients pre measured and prepped in separate bowels, pre-heated two ovens and all the pans they know you'll need, and made sure there are two large pots of boiling water already on the stoves then prehaps you can make the meal in 20 minutes on your 3rd or 4th try.

It is a lot harder to maintain selling many dishes at the same time because you need to hire more chef/cooks skilled in those dishes and also buy more ingredients and manage those ingredients' lifespan so its much easier to be profitable with a small menu of very profitable dishes or at least easier to cost manage.	forkLding	8.483826	6.173084	comment	3.0	14.0	1614110672	4.08044

For example, if an Uber eats or Deliveroo driver turns up with the wrong order, they can do literally nothing about it. If a company that employees it’s own delivery staff (eg Domino’s, supermarket chains, independents restaurants etc.) shows up with a bad order, they will go back and fix it, because it’s cheaper for everyone to do that.Outsourcing delivery to another company works for restaurants that have limited delivery orders and no marketing channel, but is it really sustainable?

So, restaurants will subsidize some of the delivery cost to sell the food.

Grocery stores have a huge, air-conditioned square footage just so that I can walk around and pick stuff out. Lots of food gets thrown out unused. I bring less packaging home, but stuff is still delivered to the grocery store in packages, I'm just outsourcing the guilt of throwing it out to the grocery store. Meanwhile, companies like Blue Apron and Imperfect batch deliveries to my building, so the carbon footprint of delivery is amortized over everyone who benefits from it.	paulgb	8.456013	6.266154	comment	3.0	11.0	1652120648	-14.714904

Deliver cooked restaurant quality food rapidly, like the ultimate take-out. Or just pop something in the oven for 20 min, etc. Cooking is time consuming and often annoying, the major pain point (for me and most people I know anyway) is not going to a grocery store once a week or finding recipes which are abundant online, it's the actual act of cooking for 30-60 minutes, for every dinner (or lunch), before 5 or 10 minutes of eating.Maybe I'm the wrong target demographic, who knows.	notadoc	8.404742	6.252638	comment	3.0	15.0	1498669448	-14.715604

For my first order, the guarantee was $6.85 and the customer, a woman in Boerum Hill who answered the door in a colorful bathrobe, tipped $3 via the app. But I still received only $6.85.> Here’s how it works: If the woman in the bathrobe had tipped zero, DoorDash would have paid me the whole $6.85.

In a fixed system, you might sometimes have to flag down a waiter rather than have your glass endlessly refilled even when you're done drinking, and folks might stop walking by asking (if you're lucky) to take your plates away before you're ready.If you're a person who travels, count the amount of visible staff at an average German restaurant, and compare that to what you see in the US.

It literally put a derivative structure onto the Dasher pay that reduces volatility -- the pay was cash plus a call option on the tip.  Now they will get cash plus the tip.  Obviously DoorDash will tune their base pay, but they can't meet the prior model's mean and variance at the same time.  How Dashers balance those two is unclear, but generally people need a higher mean to accept higher variance.The problem is that the old policy only works if the customers don't understand it, and maybe even seems generally unethical.

So tourism is actually lowering the quality of restaurants. I think because Oslo is so much more expensive than a city like Barcelona, it has a much higher percentage of well-off tourists who are a lot more demanding and have more money to spend, so you end up with more and better restaurants.	maxlamb	8.569983	6.207084	comment	3.0	12.0	1568312574	11.275202

For example, pizza delivered cold because the drivers have no heat bags. I've even heard of a pizza box mounted vertically on a delivery bicycle.- Customers are unhappy because food can be delivered cold through no fault of the restaurant. To save money, multiple deliveries can be scheduled at once. You can see this as your assigned driver drives passed the restaurant when your food is ready, clearly they're on another delivery. They come back 20 minutes later and turn what should be a 10-15 minute delivery (from the time the order is ready) to a 45 minute disaster;- And drivers don't seem happy, comp	cletus	8.6301985	6.3202085	comment	3.0	17.0	1594005565	4.195142

But the problem is two fold, many food items don’t lend themselves to delivery, and then delivery itself is expensive and doesn’t scale either.A large part of the restaurant experience is dining in, even if that doesn’t include the hospitality, the freshly prepared food will be irreplaceable. The moment it’s packed in boxes a lot of the food loses its edge and items prepared by many chefs will all seem similar. If this concept takes it will take the quality of food down globally.However I am highly skeptical  about it and the main reason is delivery, which I still think is a fundamentally unviable business.	yalogin	8.551181	6.26632	comment	3.0	10.0	1596722878	4.2175517

You tell the service that within a certain time slot, you’d like your order of [insert order here] to be delivered.2. All your neighbours do the same3. At the time slot, a vehicle (or robot) deposits the food in some kind of storage locker for you and several of your neighbours to pick up.This would substantially drive down the per-order delivery cost.A dense city where everyone lives in apartments, such as New York, would be an ideal place for this idea, since orders for everyone in your building could be dropped off at one point	spideymans	8.577343	6.225597	comment	3.0	12.0	1596725365	4.126084

Limit 5 per customer), the burgers have non-zero cost, as they require a person's time in order to purchase.If McDonalds does have enough capital to buy long-term customers and kill off competition with free burgers, perhaps they should consider it.  I assume that they've considered such a strategy on occasion and concluded that it isn't worth it. Burgers are probably worth more than $0 to McDonalds, too.

After some time one develops an instinct of how things should be be (based on color, taste, size, even sound !). For example, if one wants too cook onions, choosing between butter and oil, checking the colour, checking if it's cooked or not, deciding to add some water at some point, or additional stuff to induce better Maillard's reaction, etc. All of that you'll be able to do it without resorting to technology.That's what I find so gratifying about cooking. After 20 years, I can now make things that taste much better than in the past I'm not always sure of why :-) But lots of practice sure make a difference and it's rewarded. Plus additional bonus : you make many better moments i	wiz21c	8.342123	6.103249	comment	3.0	14.0	1597404472	11.410449

There is this insane expectation to tip at least 18%, and in fact most receipts have suggestions for 18, 20, and 22%. Any time a server has brought me one of those portable PoS terminals, it felt really awkward, as they stare at me thinking about how much tip I should give for the half-ass snooty service. I imagine many others feel this way, which is probably why it’s not popular. I spend quite a bit of time in Europe and have seen more of the PoS terminals used there, but it makes way more sense because there’s no expectation of a tip.	temporallobe	8.532701	7.0304594	comment	4.0	15.0	1667101644	-15.2862425

So, each chunk of dough is good for one pizza for one.No way do I want to try to compete with the artistry of brown spots from 600+ F wood-fired pizza ovens, etc.  I don't even want to warm up the oven in my kitchen stove.So, I put the pizza in just a clean, dry standard cast iron frying pan, put on a glass cover from a glass casserole dish set, and set the stack on a standard stove burner for 22 minutes.Doing that, the bottom got done while the top was still not hot enough, so to insulate the bottom I set	graycat	8.379446	6.3520923	comment	4.0	44.0	1671632735	11.31564

An espresso actually has much less caffeine than a cup of drip (60mg vs 200mg). Generally the longer you leave the beans exposed to water the more caffeine comes out, up to about 400 minutes when making cold brew. [1]I doubt Starbucks is deviously out to over-caffeinate its customers (although if they were, they've got my vote!) but rather the difference is attributable to variations in their brewing process.There's a limit to the amount of caffeine that can possibly come out of a bean, and so I would say that unless there's evidence they're spiking the brew, that Starbucks coffee is roughly the definition of an ""average cup of coffee""A Venti is 590mL and 415mg of caffeine, 700m"	arcticbull	7.7325788	6.2389565	comment	4.0	19.0	1616957850	11.124115

As the heat denatures some of the proteins in coffee, doing it cold extracts all the flavours without damage.Otherwise find a good espresso place (not a chain).

For small restaurants maybe they can only afford a $2 raise while breaking even. For the local car wash, maybe $1.25 is the limit. By increasing the wage to an arbitrary number ($15/hr), this ignores the market principles that each business operates under.Another thought experiment: why only $15? Why not $25? Or $50?

Historically tips came after the meal (or other service), and in theory you would tip well if you were happy with service, and badly or not at all if you were unhappy.  In itself that made a little bit of sense (w/o considering the contradictions you mentioned).But nowadays you're often expected to tip at beginning of meal (i.e., when you order and pay at register), and your tip is not tied to quality of service at all (and very often there isn't even any actual service, other than taking of order and preparation of food).  As an older person this strikes me as bizarre; grew up in atmosphere where tips were always after meal and explicitly tied to quality of service.	hsitz	8.529995	7.03736	comment	4.0	19.0	1482856245	-15.326876

27676152	My biggest cheapskate-old-man gripe 	"My biggest cheapskate-old-man gripe is how the UX as you said is systemically deteriorating in restaurants yet the tip expectations have creeped up from 15% standard to now 25% default. And, all apps that compute tip % or recommended tip amounts tip on top of tax, which really irks me as just a dark pattern to rip off patrons and inflate the tip amount. This is US tipping culture at absolute worse.I hold at 15% standard. Yet, many apps have defaults for 18%, 20%, 22%... all way up to 30% from what I've seen. And, they allow me to ""Custom Tip"" which I do once I find it (it's usually small and text instead of a button like the presets). However, once you select custom I'm back into dollars instead of percents so I have to do the math myself (and I don't even remember what the total was by th"	conductr	8.535646	7.02802	comment	4.0	30.0	1624976518	-15.287828

Spend 15 minutes waiting for the manager to come over? No thanks.> Not tipping doesn't accomplish anything and the server who has no control over the system and is already underpaid gets screwed over.I view that as ""not my problem"". I know it's wrong if the server gets screwed, I'm not arguing this is a just behavior on my part. But, if you extrapolate my behavior to all patrons the restaurant would get a hint real quick that people didn't want to tip 20%/25% and reduce the defaults."	conductr	8.532746	7.032441	comment	4.0	19.0	1624981328	-15.287351

Very few of them remain now.Instead there’s this divide with crappy $1 joints (that are now a little more expensive) and good $4-5 slice joints that had to differentiate themselves. The workingman’s NY slice might not have long to live.All that said, it sounds like maybe you’ve not had good NY pizza the way you’re describing it.

You never have to figure anything out, and sometimes people really appreciate it.This echoes the sentiment that 'if you can't afford to pay a X% tip, you can't afford to buy the product'.  Problem is that it seems to keep going up.  It use to be 10, then 15, now it is closing in on 20 and in some areas 22 seems to be the expected.  How far does this logic extend?

Considering a cost of a meal is usually $10-20, this is significant barrier. My question is: Does these startups taking on losses to build customer base?2. Cooked food is notoriously perishable. Think about eating burger lying around for 30-60 mins before you eat. This not only limits items you can deliver but also puts on pressure that you are always running against clock.

Even most people I know who have tried Blue Apron tend to either regress back to not cooking or they ""graduate"" to buying their own ingredients and planning their own meals.

You have to awkwardly peel back the top foil, dump the grounds, and then recycle the cup. Who at the office wants to sit there and do that for 20 cups in a row whenever the cup catcher fills up?What we need is some sort of cup recycler hardware that takes the work out of the annoying part. Put the used cup upside down, and a device scrapes the lid off and vaccuums the grounds into a compost holder, then you chuck the plastic into the recycle bin. That would instantly resolve the k-cup waste situation at my office.	koboll	8.343544	6.146447	comment	4.0	16.0	1545246987	4.888303

Also the postage-stamp sized restaurants with like 4 tables. This is a uniquely SF setup for restaurants and it drives me nuts.I generally love the taste and diversity of food in SF, but I feel like restaurant owners don't value their customers, nor their customer's time when they open a restaurant like this.My new rule is: if the wait is 30 minutes or more, I go somewhere else.

Some observations from visiting Asia or eating out in general:In Korea, there is a button on every table you can press to get the attention of waitstaff.  No more inefficient hoping to catch eye contact when they walk by.A lot of places now make you walk up to a register and pay as you leave.  No more having the waitstaff make 2-3 trips to your table just so you can sign.Having iPads or something for ordering is another step, but may take longer to recoup those initial investments.Focus only on a few speciality dishes, rather than offering 200 items.Edit: there’s also the automat, which was in fashion in the early 1900s in America, I believe.

By cooking with no human hand ever coming into contact with the ingredients or utensils, clearly a health benefit is accrued. And by steam-cleaning the cooker periodically, quality is improved.I'd envisioned a somewhat different robot. I thought the ingredients could be tube-delivered like caulking guns, on a rotating 'tool carousel' so you could cook different recipes by selecting and timing. And process vertically so you avoid most 'conveyor belt' issues. Finally do it as drive-thru with automated ordering (touch screen/phone app) to eliminate the rest of the human factor.The result should be good quality, fast food at a radically cheaper price.

The one I still remember is the item on the first inside page on the top right corner is the item with the highest margin, usually pasta.  The reasoning for the placement is that people who didn’t have a strong preference for what they wanted would scan the entire menu and then return to the beginning of the menu and get “stuck” in the corner on their second pass.  I’m not sure if this is based in any research but it’s a fun thing to look for when you are out to eat.	dugmartin	8.436643	6.171073	comment	4.0	39.0	1525776614	11.394132

Think of a suburban neighborhood in Madrid or Rome, where a small restaurant is just as common as a tabacchi / corner convenience store.I believe (have not seen a careful study yet) that the rent-seeking / zoning policies of our cities in the US increase greatly the cost of running restaurants.

It’s the restaurant who is still wrapping up right now! If they even tell you that. Then they drop off a few other orders on the way.

There is no way to stop it. This will create carbonic acid and elevate the pH. Which absolutely will impact the flavor. Part of the extraction ""dialing in"" process is determining the dose, temperature, grind, and duration for a new bean (and as it ages). The last thing you want it so add more acidity to the flavor. Some people do like sour espresso, I do not, and I think I'm in the majority.Second, consistency of pressure. A CO2 canister output pressure changes with temperature and volume.

In those countries, a fast-food meal is around US$20.Traditional restaurants and/or fast casual spots in the USA involve “mandatory” tipping, so even if menu prices are lower, I would assume that the total meal price is higher once one includes the tip, which nowadays is up to at least 20% if not 25%. I remember a Facebook thread that drew some angry wait staff posting things like “You better tip X% or you’re going to get some nastiness in your food next time”, and they were mainly coming from low-end chains.

I was already paying $5 for a really tiny cup and then another $1 that showed up as the suggested tip on the card reader. The employee was looking directly at me and I couldn't see the option for ""No Tip"" fast enough. So I had to click on $1.That $1 didn't mean anything to me until then. It was suddenly a tax I was paying for not being Larry David :)The businesses who think that are striking a balance between good customer service and paying fair wages don't realize that the consumers are leaving with a bad taste in their mouths."	malshe	8.538834	7.014178	comment	4.0	16.0	1695076155	-15.284393

Schultz had actually left Starbucks and started his own coffee chain (Il Giornale) when the founders of Starbucks didn't want to expand the number of stores. They mostly just wanted to roast coffee. When the chance to buy Peet's came up, they decided to buy that instead and put Starbucks up for sale. Schultz was actually super passionate about Starbucks and jumped at the opportunity to buy it. Then one of his investors from Il Giornale tried to undercut him by putting in a higher bid for Starbucks. Bill Gates' dad was apparently a highly respected lawyer in the Seattle area and Schultz went to him for help. Bill Gates Sr. called the investor and gave him some tough talks and the investor withdrew his bid. It's incredible that senior G	hangonhn	7.839621	6.3101554	comment	4.0	61.0	1600211959	4.7328005

Sometimes it might be because the waiter himself releases that by freeing up the table for another set of diners, he stands to get obligatory-tipped twice that evening instead of just once. But with a culture of obligatory tipping, customers h	Mediterraneo10	8.530262	7.0073504	comment	4.0	13.0	1606059465	-15.282512

To the extent that the fees cover paying the driver, then it's not really fair to 'blame' the apps for 'gutting' the restaurant industry. But I have no idea if this is 30% of the fees or 5%.Just to be clear, I'm not defending the apps and I have literally never used any of them.

In other words, bad support and tip stealing.  We referred to it as ""DoorTrash"" or ""PoorDash"" for that reason.

They last a couple of years depending on care which means that your cookware is now a consumable as well was difficult to recycle.  A decent stainless steel pan costs about twice what a decent non-stick does and lasts forever.  It can also go in the dishwasher and works on every hob type.  The best basic advice for the majority of people to make regarding cookware is: get stainless steel except for when frying eggs.The advice in TFA is sort of similar but a lot longer.

It should also only ever be used with a rubber spatula or plastic utensils.For any other food, stainless steel is great for beginners. It's oven safe, easy to clean if/when you burn the crap out of something, and relatively cheap.The other important recommendation I would make is cookware with tight fitting lids (or learn how to make one with foil). This excludes IKEA for the most part, whose pans I have in my apartment right now.Once you decide that you want to ""upgrade"" something, I would recommend a nice Dutch oven with a heavy lid."	yurishimo	8.742652	6.122559	comment	4.0	16.0	1702853934	-12.273079

Customer service is just dreadful.I once ordered food from a place maybe 10-15 blocks away.  It took ~hours~ for the food to arrive because the delivery driver decided to take an hour phone call right down the street, food in hand.  We had to go find him, as support was non-existent.  A little while later they offered to credit $3 for the issue: not even covering the delivery fee we paid to go hunt down our own food.  This is a typical experience: anytime anything goes wrong Postmates support is worthless.	SirensOfTitan	8.622393	6.450923	comment	4.0	36.0	1504202928	4.079621

Not apples to apples.The markup on food (based on ingredients only) and wine is similar (3x). It costs virtually nothing to store wine or to prepare it for sale. But the process to take ingredients and make a meal takes a lot of labour and machines.	rahimnathwani	8.358486	6.148083	comment	4.0	14.0	1534481596	4.044209

A McDonalds meal is $10 as it is so you're going to add a couple more bucks for the convenience of not having to get it, plus a tip to the delivery person?Sure, I can understand the spending $20 to not have to take a lunch or to stay later at work and eating dinner there. But for the most part it's ridiculous. I mean there's even a delivery order station at the 7-11. Who's getting a Slurpe"	bluedino	8.573005	6.256029	comment	4.0	15.0	1705848090	4.178371

1) Fill the basket level. You may tap/shake any clumps to get it level but do not tamp.
2) Heat it on 1000 watts until the first drop of coffee comes out the pipe and then reduce power 400w.
3) When you notice any hint of yellow, or any bubbles/spluttering or you have enough coffee then immediately dump it into a pre-warmed mug of milk. Ideally you want to stop the process before any bitterness arrives."	andersrs	7.71472	6.1415763	comment	4.0	14.0	1706005487	11.168257

Another good tip is to use the right pasta for the right sauce.As any Italian would explain, Spaghetti Bolognese is not actually a thing at least not what you think it is. You wouldn't use spaghetti for a meat sauce but a bit more chunky kind of pasta like tagliatelle or papardelle. You'd use spaghetti for a fish pasta; which is what you risk getting in Bologna if you are ordering a spaghetti bolognese. Basically, they'd serve you a tuna & tomato sauce. Nothing wrong with that of course. But if you want their famous meat sauce, order pasta alla ragu.

Delivery is still certainly more expensive than going into the store, but not having to deal with driving somewhere to pick it up al	kelnos	8.682747	6.172888	comment	4.0	15.0	1657743294	0.3975488
32095816	> The problem with these insane pric	> The problem with these insane prices isn't really that you have disparity within the same country, but that a significant amount of people in these places cannot afford to live in there. You can't have a restaurant because you need to hire waiters but you can't pay waiters enough for them to pay the rent. So your service industry is disrupted or alternatively: people need to commute 1 or 2 hours to get to these jobs.Haven't you described a problem that fixes itself through market forces? Restaurant waiters move to other cities, restaurants (and millions of other businesses) close, city becomes less desirable, rents go down.	golergka	8.53717	6.1861534	comment	4.0	13.0	1657805236	3.9613652

Now any time you need carmelized onions, take a portion out of the freezer and thaw.

No other recipes tend to use this style, because it is harder to read.If I write recipes in cooklang, the plain text of the recipes is harder to understand without tools that speak cooklang, forcing me to use the tools to get an understandable format. The output of the CLI tool seems like a better format than the format itself!	rpearl	8.230936	6.1127863	comment	4.0	18.0	1687912091	11.449955

Say you had a recipe for 12 muffins but you only wanted to make 6 or 4, it could automatically divide those quantities and spit out a new recipe or shopping list.Another cool CLI feature would be unit conversion; converting things like fluid ounces, or cups into ml.My other piece of feedback is the overloading of {} for ending multi-word ingredient seems a bit off. It's more syntax but I'd still rather have something dedicated for that purpose eg. @(ground black pepper)"	22c	8.228709	6.102902	comment	4.0	14.0	1687912382	11.454241

I have the full gamut with carbon steel, cast iron, non-stick and stainless steel, and find myself mostly leaning on the carbon steel.  (I don't have any other materials since I cook on induction.)But here's a catch:  that seasoning?  Basically a plastic.  It's polymerized cooking oil.  You can decide if you care.  But you'll also polymerize oil when cooking on stainless.  Basically:  if you want to go ultra-paranoid, don't fry things.	wheels	8.734094	6.1158586	comment	4.0	36.0	1688126190	-12.29773

What's not to like?A similar dynamic will likely play out in other industries where tipping is common as well.Alas, I do end up tipping in real life because I don't want delivery workers to suffer more than they have to in the mean time until not-tipping becomes the norm and wages increase as a result, so it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.	ss3000	8.531188	7.0480175	comment	4.0	12.0	1591848390	-15.289497

Both of these statements are simultaneously true.The vast majority of the countries in the world (that I've visited) do not believe in percentage based tipping as we do in North America [1]. A tip either involves rounding up to the nearest unit of currency, or takes the form of a small service fee added to the bill.In North America, we've arrived at a situation where waitstaff actually prefer a tipped environment (due to high upside potential, especially where alcohol is served) and are also beholden to the tip (due to huge downside potential i.e. laws that mandate a lowered minimum wage for tipped workers).Getting rid of tipping by instituting a living wage can sometimes result in lower upside, so many workers end up being against a fixed liva	wenc	8.525559	7.033602	comment	4.0	13.0	1597725309	-15.285765

If you underpay on some trips and overpay on others and it is a net wash, then it doesn't really matter for the couriers if the payment algorithm is on the low side on some trips so long as it is on the high side on other trips.Under or overpaying on trips is more of an interest to those engineers trying to optimize marketplace efficiency. Meal delivery businesses have as much of an interest in not underpaying as doing so reduces supply availability and therefore reliability and they have also an interest in not overpaying as that reduces profitability. The ultimate goal is optimal pricing in a three sided market to maximize liquidity as the business model does best when you optimize for volume of transactions.

Literally 15 seconds and food is on the way.Compare this to having to call someone, wait on hold, give my phone number/address, tell them my order, correct the mistakes, find my wallet, get out my credit card, give them the number, confirm the number and expiration and security code, then sign a paper copy with the tip when the driver drops it off.Can I do the old style of delivery?

It was a lot of work.It is also inherently more expensive to sell. All of the same things that make regular instant coffee taste bad also make it super cheap.

If he is spending a lot of time standing around, well, then his wages are going to have to be cut. It could easily be cut to such a low level so that the waiter can't pay his bills and has to quit.So restaurants can be in the simultaneous situation of not being able to hire enough workers to handle some peak hours, but also not being able to pay those workers enough to work full time for them.And raising prices again results in fewer customers who can always eat at home or order delivery, which doesn't need the waiter.

The pattern of product offerings in your average store suggests people want something affordable, and it doesn't particularly matter whether it is good at its job.I've always wondered if we could fix this through legislation that forces manufacturers of consumer goods to provide an estimate of product lifetime according to some agreed standard - the same way that manufacturers of large appliances have to provide information about energy and water use.As it stands, it's really hard for the consumer to know whether or not the $1000 coffee machine is actually better quality than the $500 one, or whether they're just milking a fancy brand name and relying on FUD.

Most of the time, it feels like the tip shouldn't be necessary; the employers should be covering the cost of the employee. If people get used to declining tip prompts, it's possible that we see this change in behavior make its way into the restaurant industry.At least for me, personally, I'm nearly at the point where I want to stop tipping entirely. It just seems so unnecessary and just another way that the capital class deflects blame for inadequate employee pay.	rcme	8.533053	7.0422425	comment	4.0	14.0	1674246245	-15.289923

And the act of actually having to press no tip is better at guilting people than simply being able to ignore a tip jar.And then the point of sale providers got even more greedy and removed the no tip option, and started making it so users had to press “custom tip” in order to tip zero or otherwise increase the friction of not tipping.	lotsofpulp	8.534331	7.046422	comment	4.0	22.0	1674592643	-15.286845

On the other hand, it's nice for someone of modest means to treat themselves to a restaurant or hotel at a lower price. Those are pro-consumer considerations, but service workers are also consumers of many other things.	cat_plus_plus	8.528136	7.025645	comment	4.0	13.0	1677124167	-15.279053

Since Dashers will earn a guaranteed minimum rate, the benefits offered by this program will not apply in NYC. The Top Dasher program is still available for qualified NYC Dashers.So they're guaranteeing higher pay for all workers, and cutting a benefit for their best workers? I wonder what kind of impact this will have. Will this encourage some of these top workers to leave the platform, since they can no longer get access to good orders based on their track record?	gnicholas	8.645719	6.850642	comment	5.0	17.0	1701721947	0.3738778

Zero advantage for anyone other than DoorDash unless you consider being able to search for the food in a single app and paying extra for it to be cold on arrival an advantage.	bigtunacan	8.582863	6.3489904	comment	5.0	17.0	1701733912	4.139828

Raising prices 20% and eliminating tipping reduces employee income even though it is nominally revenue neutral because it changes customer spending behavior. Employees don't get paid a 20% service charge for money customers don't spend. The assumption that the customer is not influenced by the structure of the transaction if the final bill would be the same does not hold up empirically. This is not an intuitive outcome, I don't think either restauranteurs or employees expected it when it was first tried, but the result was replicated many times.Since the market for good employees is competitive, restaurants that replace tipping with a 20% service charge have more difficulty finding and retaining employees.

Unfortunately it appears that this can be a challenge because consumers aren't used to the higher cost menu items. Even though a $30 entre with no tip is roughly the same cost as a $25 entre where a tip is expected apparently consumer behavior changed significantly.

I mean, I could understand if the development costs were being funded by VC money, but actual deliveries? Even if one company were to actually dominate the market, it would still need to continue subsidizing variable costs and there is no moat to protect them from competition.	sbacic	8.550635	6.2505236	comment	5.0	21.0	1632129013	4.056415

Select a few cuisines, get great chefs to develop recipes that anyone can be trained to execute flawlessly, set up locations strategically situated to minimize delivery time/distance. It might not end up being Michelin-star-quality food, but then none of the places I order deliver from are, either.As a consumer, my biggest problems with delivery are speed and quality. Places I order from routinely take 60+ minutes to deliver, even if they're close by. Quality is the bigger problem, and I suspect a lot of people feel the same.	lobster_johnson	8.5808735	6.310537	comment	5.0	15.0	1499641669	4.2303014

Sprig gave me a protein and veggie I could order without thinking too hard.I get why the food delivery model doesn't work well in the US for anyone, and I did notice Sprig's decline in food quality, but I am still sad the company is gone.	fasteddie	8.475015	6.195216	comment	5.0	19.0	1593195983	4.094699

The tipping and per-delivery payments to drivers is why it works.Roughly speaking, a delivery driver in my area nearly a decade ago earned roughly $20/hr after gas and car expenses, half in hourly wages @ state minimum and the other half in tips + $1/delivery payment. They also took about 3 deliveries an hour when fully utilized, which wasn't for 100% of their shift. The wait time got used productively, combination of answering phones, making pizzas, or at worst folding boxes.This combination means that you're employing people at a significnatly-above-minimum-wage level, but their excess time waiting for deliveries gets paid at minimum wage and used to do customer service.

Visiting is equivalent to going to a FedEx: You know what to expect, but you don't go there for pleasure.That's good and expected for fast food (i.e. McDonald's), but fast food is something you do on the go: Using drive through or picking up, or when I was younger sitting in only transitionally with my friends to gulp down the fast food in the middle of our night out.Luckily at least in the cities there are still a wide variety of individual restaurants, often better than where I'm from, especially (but not exclusively) if it comes to non-local cuisine. The chains take up space but they are still easy enough to ignore.	anyfoo	8.474521	6.1404886	comment	5.0	50.0	1654291583	11.362031

Many of the best servers and bartenders I know left the profession during the pandemic and have not come back.

The reason they are so successful is they have employees take your order as you are waiting, so there are never any bottlenecks around order taking and order receiving.Granted there's a tradeoff, CFA made the calculation that the extra labor costs for the drive through would be worth the throughput (they usually only do it during ""rush hours"").

You're letting the market figure out the right price for delivery service at any given moment, which reduces deadweight loss. For instance, if you're price sensitive you can order during off-peak times to get a discount. On the other hand, if it's peak hours and you need food urgently (impatient kids?), you can be assured that your order arrives ASAP rather than 1 hour later.2.

Nobody I've ever met who waits tables is happy with $120/night out the door pretax ($15/hr * 8)For a restaurant to pay a server what they make now ($150-$300/night tips), their labor cost would be through the roof and they would have to raise the price of the food.The customer wouldn't like that.Lose lose lose."

I would hate it. I like giving tips. I wouldn't go to a restaurant where tipping was not allowed.Plus, the restaurant has to raise their prices up by 20% anyways, because they now have to pay their wait staff more. The customer pays anyways. So it's a stupid thing not to have tipping. You're not going to save any money at all as the customer. It's impossible to save money.Furthermore, I know waitstaff that make a considerable amount of money from tips. Like, $300-$400 per shift and more. That's about $80,000 to $105,000 per year.

This makes our food somewhat expensive: at least $20 for a sit-in meal, around $4.50 for a coffee.But what you see on the menu is what you pay and includes tax: tipping is not in our culture, and I have never seen drip charging here except on public holidays (“public holiday surcharge”).Our consumer rights laws probably protect our right to walk away and not pay undisclosed drip charges, although it has never happened to me.—Admittedly, the award wage makes it difficult for newly established bootstrapped businesses to hire their first staff.

I've been using an Aeropress for some months now, and even if I keep all the major variable the same, it still tastes different.I don't trust my senses here entirely, and as it's not blind I can easily fool myself. But the amount of agitation and differences in pouring might affect the taste here sometimes. Though my impression is that this is not always noticeable, but if I'm on the border of the coffee becoming bitter or sour it gets noticeably variable between preparations.The other part that I'm quite sure of is that the temperature you drink at affects taste a lot more than I thought.

You wouldn’t say it’s not a hamburger unless it’s from Hamburg. Or a Philly cheesesteak unless it’s made within city limits.Yes, the specific taste can be specific to the region’s produce or historic process but that’s true of anything if you’re willing to mythologize it. You shouldn’t be able to claim it made where it isn’t but Dijon mustard meaning “mustard made in the style as popularized in the town of Dijon” is not something you get to claim geographic dominion over long long long after it’s been the genericized accepted term for the specific food.

Start their own restaurant selling really bad food at expensive prices.4. Profit.This is the same kind of strategy that tech giants often follow to push startups out of business.

A fast, but rude server could serve 100 muffins, but perhaps get 0-10% tip each sale. A slow, but polite server may only serve 50 muffins, but garner 20% tip each.If you simply jack the muffin price up and distribute equally among all servers, as you suggest, then there is no incentive to perform above average - no lesson learned for lackluster performance.Personally, I tip anywhere between 15 - 30%, understanding that this is part of the servers anticipated income.

One of the nice things in this country is that they have a numbering system for classifying flour and they have lots of different varieties that are available in most supermarkets. A few years ago I got into making pizza's from scratch and sort of did a deep dive into what these numbers mean and in the process figured out what to look for in flour.In the case of a pizza you want finely milled white flour with lots of protein. That means in the numbering system the Germans have you don't want to go too high. The numbers refer to dry ashes (mostly minerals) that remain after burning a certain amount of flour. Dark breads tend to have higher numbers. The darker the higher. Germans really love their dark breads.

But compared to grocery stores and cooking from scratch blue apron is too expensive for me.edit: Blue apron is currently $7.50 - $9.99 per serving. I cook delicious food for myself regularly for less than $4 per serving if I make enough to have leftovers for a day or two.

I also suspect online orders probably on average larger than drive up orders because it's easier to order more. On the other hand, there is very very minimal advertising of the app at the store.

People didn't plan for it, because it is implied in our various social contracts that they don't need to(and that may be wrong, but this is not the time to fix that).We should consider subsidizing the restaurants to continue to do what they do best: provide food.  We need to meet in the middle and provide some assistance while still getting 'wealth'(desired goods and services in this case) but not fully subsidizing empty buildings and idle employees.  The delivery or pick-up models work in a pandemic, but they fail to provide enough profit to keep businesses open.

Actually measuring your coffee and your water precisely yields a big difference. Buy a small scale for measuring the bean weight, and either use a precise measuring cup for water volume, or just weigh the water as well.I make my morning coffee for my girlfriend and myself via French Press, and so I also tweaked the measurements a few time to account for the fact that 8oz of water + ground beans will not actually yield 8oz of coffee, due to the loss of liquid that is retained by the ground beans ev"	AdmiralAsshat	7.766635	6.2553577	comment	5.0	24.0	1601043819	11.136928

If the tip is lower than the order e.g. someone tips $7 on a $10 then you still only receive $10. Now that they have capped the maximum tip to $10 they have eliminated the only way to make money off of DoorDash tips. When you're tipping on DoorDash you're tipping DoorDash, not the worker.Maybe they changed the tipping system and what I'm talking about doesn't make any sense but I'm not optimistic when it comes to DoorDash.	imtringued	8.573598	6.944977	comment	5.0	29.0	1602936275	-15.250523

Tip in cash, square cash or Venmo. This still provides drivers the guaranteed minimum from the service and the tip you give in cash is truly 100% going to the person as a bonus.The worst part of this though is DoorDash outright deceiving me by prominently saying 100% of the tip goes to Dashers every time I checkout. When I read that I assume it’s a bonus, not that DoorDash will then reduce their portion of the pay. Seeing that message, I’ve been religiously tipping via DoorDash, not any more.

All coffee is sorted by size, or at least all quality coffee. It's necessary, not only for an even roast, but it's also an inherent part of green coffee processing. You have to screen and sort the beans to dry them.The reason grocery coffee is bad is simple. They roast it until the oils come out and then the oils go rancid because it has been sitting on the shelf for the last 6 months getting to you. Even if it hasn't gone rancid (way more common than you'd guess), it's still stale and overroasted. Americans	earthscienceman	7.7712016	6.2628875	comment	6.0	35.0	1551970377	4.8522573

Or do you mean that if they're no longer glistening that the bag is probably stale?FWIW, most of what I buy (except for the Costco bag that I take to work) has a roasting date on the back so that I can guarantee a certain degree of freshness.

While I would like to believe that what you say is true, I find it hard to be true.I think the bigger issues are at play whether it's is the fact that minimum wages need to be adjusted, a more modern solution is needed to replace minimum wages, whether a job in question is simply suitable for a human to perform (in this case a doorman, they don't really have them where I live so I don't know their purpose), or maybe children (even adults) need to be taught better money management skills.I personally think that an area for quick improvement would be helping folks with managing their money.

There was no tip option on the receipt (didn't see it anywhere in Japan) and there was no tip jar. I asked the server if I could tip.She told me they couldn't accept my tip because they believed the food was priced correctly.It was a totally different experience than in America where not tipping gets you poor service and unhappy waiters.

18241858	The 'politics' of tipping aside, one	The 'politics' of tipping aside, one thing that really grinds my gears is that they calculate the tip after taxes are applied. I feel that the tips should be calculated based on the exchange I had with the establishment/person and that the taxes should considered separate from our interaction. Like, here's the 20% tip on the 100$ I spent. Not, here's the 20% tip on the $100 + 5% tax, $105 total. I know why they do this, it's more money to them, but, to me, it's disingenuous (or they don't realize it being done this way, which may be worse).

With the site, you can do the following.- Add your own recipes.- ""Clip"" recipes from anywhere on the web.- Find a recipe on the site you like? You can save it to your profile so you can easily find it later.- Organize recipes into collections and share them with anyone.- Search from 20,000+"	x86mitch	8.249229	6.1748476	comment	6.0	23.0	1570399752	11.411099

The tip field was off-screen, and the ordering software didn't have a confirmation screen, just a ""we just charged your card $X amount"" screen, which made my eyes boggle.EDIT: Looking at the original March 17th, 2015 bug, it would have been at exactly around that time...In fact, checking my emails, this happened on March 18th, 2015.

And about as expensive. It's probably easier to automate the managers away. Meaning the McDonald's of tomorrow will surely rely on a horde of human personnel for food preparation and related simple tasks for the foreseeable future.But of course it's kind of convenient if people at least think that their job can be automated tomorrow: that makes it easier to make them sell their workforce for peanuts today.

The people did everything from making the burgers to taking the orders to cleaning the tables and taking out the trash. All of these employees reported to the store manager and a couple of assistant managers. The managers hired the employees, scheduled them and told them what to do each day.

He's worth about $3.7bCan somebody who is worth between $20m and $3.7b really just... hang out broad daylight behind a counter at a Starbucks from a security perspective?Obviously I get the gap between $20m (he's just starting out, I'm sure his net worth will grow to at least $50m shortly if he does well at Starbucks) and $3.7b is huge. But at what point is going outside (without security? where people know you will be?) kind of a risk?	MuffinFlavored	7.834184	6.313366	comment	6.0	19.0	1679598599	4.726281

At least for me, tipping has been one of those things that I wish were different like Europe, but it exists and there's a social norm around 15%. But given the option to ""be the jerk"" and not tip or normalize 30%!? 30% is insane. If 30 is on the screen I'm hitting zero. It's not normal. I'm not sure how these point of sale systems work and who is pushing these new norms, but I'd be interested to hear some story or justification for the new highs."	davidjfelix	8.532749	7.0359936	comment	6.0	57.0	1679842874	-15.287221

Restaurants, in particular, are horribly low margin.The end result of getting rid of ""terrible"" jobs, is that everything at the restaurant costs 2-3x as much, and so on at the many other businesses (agriculture?) which rely on cheap labor.

Nearly since its inception, a substantial portion of McDonald's long term profit came from the appreciation of the real estate the stores were built on.  Operating a business on it just made it cash flow positive during the holding period.  So it was essentially a REIT that happened to operate a fast food chain.  Even for many mom-and-pop restaurants (or other business) the real payoff often comes when it comes time to sell and cash in on the capital appreciation of the business assets.My point isn't to say there's anything wrong with that model: more power to anyone who comes up with a creative, legal way to make a living.

First off, plenty of restaurants in New York do that and the problem persists.  The underlying problem is that with scalpers buying reservations, they are proving that the market will bear a higher price.  People that buy scalped reservations are paying the scalper a fee which WILL NOT be applied to their bill.  That means the restaurant is undercharging.The solution to this problem is to handle restaurant reservations like airline reservations.  They check your ID before you can board the plane.  No reason that restaurants can't do the same.

But those Pizza boxes also has a voucher on the packaging for...a free pizza.  So I'd buy a pizza and get two free.  Then use those two vouchers to buy two more pizza's and free ones.  This I repeated daily throughout the promotional period in low volumes like that, so as to not raise awareness of the oversight.   Upshot was I had a whole month of free frozen pizza, two filled up freezers of pizza and on top of that, only ever paid for that initial pizza.  Was a good period of savings on the back of that promotion at a time in which money was very tight.  Also after the store B	Zenst	8.476488	6.336827	comment	6.0	19.0	1565608568	11.219151

In my experience there are far better examples in non-chain restaurants that would warrant a bit of a wait.Your comment may have convinced me to swing by a Popeyes, during a low usage time period, and give it a try.	cco	8.464825	6.178155	comment	6.0	23.0	1566586885	11.340481

Sir Kensingtons is okay, but not great.Some people just want to dispute the fact that Heinz is, empirically, a great product. In my opinion, Heinz might even be a special case of this. What I mean by this is I'm not sure I've ever used Heinz somewhere where I thought ""you know, Sir Kensingtons would really be better in this situation"".French's mustard is good, but not as versatile. I'd easily prefer a sandwich with Beaver over French's in most cases, but French's over any dijon for a hot dog.

The escalation of niceness and virtue signalling seems right now to be creating an expectation of that generosity, which undermines it, since it can feel non-optional,  but sometimes it's still just a nice thing one human can do to recognize another human.	q845712	8.532702	7.0483766	comment	6.0	25.0	1674520953	-15.289223

It is quite literally impossible to predict the final cost of service, so as a rule of thumb I have come to generally expect to be out of pocket about 50% - 80% more than the listed price.Any other country would call this fraud."	yafbum	8.542727	6.8511224	comment	6.0	42.0	1674539418	-15.278172

34513424	One thing I've noticed recently on 2	One thing I've noticed recently on 2 restaurant trips in the last couple weeks: The automatic tip calculations are wrong in the server/restaurant's favor. Most of us typically check the 20% option and don't double-check the math, but in the past these calculations were always done pre-tax. If your food came to $100 and you tipped 20%, the total would be $120 + sales tax.Now, the last 2 times I've eaten out the automatic tip calculation was done on the post-tax amount. I live in Alameda county where the sales tax is over 10%, so this is a big difference. Not only that, the default tip options were something like 18, 20, and 25%.The only reason I can see for restaurants to do this is that the minimum wage here is $15/hour, and if tips alone don't make that rate, the restaurant pays out of po	illumin8	8.537353	7.005777	comment	6.0	24.0	1674612009	-15.290804

It feels impossible to leave the house even alone without spending $40 on even the smallest meal that isn't fast food.I went to IHOP and got an omelette, hash browns and toast (extra $5) in a city recently, and with a 20% tip it came to $29 for just that meal - $17 + 5 + $2 tax + $5 tip. The food cost can't have been more than $4. Its getting way out of hand, and yes minimum wage is getting higher but thats not a sufficient reason. Have noticed this isn't nearly a problem in cities with lower real estate costs. You can still get a $12 diner meal in chicago for instance.	taurath	8.513423	6.666974	comment	6.0	19.0	1674932994	-15.280471

If everyone did that, a couple of things would happen:  - servers would have to push for higher pay
  - restaurants and bars would raise their prices

Then turn the heat down to low and cook for a further 45-60 mins, check on it and stir every 10 mins or so. When it gets dry, add water and use it to deglaze the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. It's finished when the onions are a deep brown colour and their volume has reduced to about 1/6th of what it was to begin with.

Basically, the internal temperature never got over 360°F, and in fact after eight minutes of running the heater would turn off and the unit would cool down to 270°F and then maintain that temperature.

If you go to a very popular place, you and your party may end up spending more time in the line to get in than on your table. So the tradeoff between going to a restaurant just to eat and getting food delivered is fairly small.In other countries (e.g., Mediterranean region),  it is perfectly normal to linger for a couple of hours after finishing your dinner.

We'd been wanting one for years, but everything reliable seemed to be $1k+, and still seemed like more work than I wanted to put into coffee.This one is simple, almost as easy as pour-over, and is simple to clean. We're making better coffee at home than we've ever had in a coffee shop. And I thought it would take a while to dial in, but the first shots were great and they've only gotten better.It's a little spendy, but if you buy espresso-based drinks it pays for itself in no time.https://www.breville.com/us/en/products/espresso/bes870.html	japhyr	7.7915154	6.318046	comment	7.0	23.0	1621522442	-7.753062

A real side effect of this will probably be restaurant prices going up (no idea of the amount), and that might make people less likely to tip.  There's also a psychological effect that not tipping or tipping less doesn't feel as bad now that the workers are getting a real wage on top of tips.I wonder if this will be the end of tipping.  That seems simpler than trying to remember how much to tip is normal where based on laws like this.	everforward	8.529478	7.0358195	comment	7.0	24.0	1696621107	-15.292049

The whole point of this bill is to prevent bait-and-switch, where loads of unknown or variable fees are tacked on after the price is initially shown.The one caveat I'd say about a tip is if it's mandatory. E.g. if a place requires a minimum tip amount for large parties, it's no longer a tip, it's appropriately called a service charge.	hn_throwaway_99	8.533144	7.029794	comment	7.0	135.0	1696831170	-15.284742

No one had even made eye contact with me up to this point. I have ordered fast food from a computer. When I have eaten it, I'm expected to bus my own table.And yet, I felt bad for removing the tip before placing my order, and kind of slunk away from the kiosk hoping the kitchen in the back doesn't know whether or not I tipped, so they can't spit on my burger.	jmcphers	8.534478	7.023562	comment	7.0	51.0	1699578015	-15.290187

I settled on a french press, even though the AeroPress does makes nicer coffee, and is easier to clean. But the french press is much simpler, an important consideration in the part of the morning when you pretty much by definition have not yet had any coffee.I don't own a Chemex or other pour-over brewer, but I would put them above the AeroPress. They're less fiddly to brew with, can produce more coffee, the quality is very similar (imo), and cleanup is not much worse.	draw_down	7.788562	6.3062844	comment	7.0	40.0	1585853387	-7.692592

Sometimes they'll insist, but you can still just... not pay it, if you don't plan on going back. It's not like they're going to call the police, and you're paying the main bill.Unfortunately, it's not infrequent for restaurants to also withhold any unpaid part of the bill from a server's tips.

But I most frequently see the comparison as: ""$5/mo means giving up just a cup of coffee once a month"".In this formulation, I think it's a pretty reasonable comparison, since a prospective user doesn't have to sacrifice much (just a semi-luxury item, one day a month) in order to use your service. The author's criticisms don't seem to hold as much purchase (no pun intended) in this context.I'd be curious to know if others think of cup-of-coffee pricing as $5/mo or $5/day.

Having never used it, I don't necessarily see the 2.6b$ value in a smaller delivery app that is only really used in some areas of the US. Though I'm sure there is something I'm missing and 2.6b$ is probably less expensive than the cost of pricing Postmates out of the market especially considering it's an all stocks deal. It's just that delivery seems to be easily scalable and easy to just dump money in to gain users (free delivery / delivery fees are much stronger factors than brand loyalty in my experience) so why acquire relatively minor players?What's also interesting is that Postmates seems to have raised around 700m$, so chances are it's investors are probably the first to make an actual realized profit from food delivery ;).	mardifoufs	8.606206	6.411537	comment	8.0	53.0	1594003356	4.126818

This can take a long time.3: they want to pre clean the table, at which we say we are done, bring the check please4: they drop off the check, if you are lucky, you can hand the card to them then,5: If not, wait for them to come back to pick up your credit card6: wait some unknown amount of time for them to bring your card back so you can sign and leave a tipIt's so much easier to pay up front and leave the second you are ready.

The price you see advertised is the price you pay, and they won't even take your tip.  (There are a few exceptions: some American-style cafes have been putting tipping jars at the register; very annoying.)  The only caveat is the tax: that's not always counted in the price, so many restaurants show two prices, the pre-tax price and the post-tax price just below it (usually in a smaller font).The other thing that's MUCH better about Japan vs. Europe is that water is free.

However, the restaurants you order from will always throw cutlery packets in regardless of your choice.The reason is that sometimes customers forget that they need cutlery, or click the box by accident, or the person preparing the order read it wrong. If the customer doesn't have anything to eat their food with they'll be understandably upset and leave a bad review.

If people want good tasting coffee, like a connoisseur, one would like the option of selecting the type of bean, where it is sourced from, how it's roasted, how it's ground, how it's brewed etc. People even vehemently oppose and stand by brewing methods, which to an ordinary person who doesn't care about coffee, wouldn't care about.And if someone is buying instant coffee anyways, I doubt they care about the taste, or have preferred methods of milk/cream and sugar that would make any drown out any nuanced/bad flavor of ANY coffee.	truthexposer	7.7660947	6.2754445	comment	8.0	66.0	1490225455	4.8637886

The product itself has been engineered for decades to be as palate-pleasing and inexpensive as possible. The humans preparing and serving the food are the only weak link in the chain, and they’re treated as such.All of this so we can eat cheap, predictable burgers.

As this article details well, the great majority of tea consumed in the UK was and continues to be at the very lowest levels of quality (even if it is not widely adulterated as it was in the past). The only places with good tea drinking cultures and where people are judges of good tea are where tea is grown and has been grown for centuries. That is China, Japan and Taiwan. (And to a much lesser degree, India and Sri Lanka).	oska	7.760894	6.1047015	comment	8.0	32.0	1555810713	11.131451

If you go to a popular spot for dinner that happens to be completely full and ask for a table, the waiter will usually shrug their shoulders and say 'Sorry, try again tomorrow.' Usually, there is no concept of a waiting list or a waiting time estimate, because diners are conditioned that they can spend 3 or 4 hours over a bottle of wine, and there would be no pressure to pay and leave, so waiters find it impossible to make any promises regarding when a table would free up. Additionally, the waitstaff won't be paid extra to make an effort and try to serve more tables on a given night (being on a fixed salaries), so they'll be quite leisurely about their business.Of course	pzh	8.52816	7.0032177	comment	8.0	31.0	1482825769	-15.284981

Who would have guessed.The endgame has always been to monopolize the market with aggressive marketing and huge discounts for customers, financed by VC.

Because lower-price restaurants would have a choice: dramatically raise their food prices (which would almost certainly drive inflation across the board as everyone in all industries would hopefully see raises to deal with increased costs of living) or try to minimize the hit. If the latter, this would set off an immediate price war, even if unintentional, because McDonald's especially would strive to keep their prices from changing as little as possible.Then, the smaller chains that couldn't afford to reduce their workforce and/or invest in efficiency or robotics wouldn't survive.

None of this excites a moral panic. Kitchen labor-saving devices have been being invented for hundreds of thousands of years. What's new?Think about wheat. Wheat used to be ground in stone mills operated by oxen or wind or water, which is much more labor-intensive than today's mills. Before that, the grinding process was even more labor-intensive.	greglindahl	7.8038645	6.312216	comment	8.0	81.0	1507517978	-7.7616816

The reasons:1. The higher base prices do have a negative impact on sales.
2. The best servers usually want tips, because they can make more at a tipping establishment.In the past 10/15 years I've changed my attitude around tipping now that pretty much every place I go to ""flips around the iPad"", asking for a tip.

All the full service restaurants in my small town still do well. The ones that don’t are the sandwich shops where you pay $14 for a cold sandwich.

Let's call that 1.5 cups a day. A pound will provide 48 6 oz cups which will last you 48/1.5 = 1 month.So it doesn't matter that your coffee was roasted very near where you live since on average it's two weeks old.Me, I live in Oakland and I like a local roaster McLaughlin in Emeryville. I can get beans or ground from Farmer Joes, also local. But I don't overvalue locality to the extreme. I buy McLaughlin because I like the taste and for what it's worth, I buy ground not bean.

It's a basic economic tenet that as the price of a good or service raises, less is purchased (Except for Giffen goods [1]).As a thought exercise, consider the effect of raising the minimum wage to $100 in a town. What would happen to restaurants in that town? They would have to raise their prices drastically to cover the new expenses. Customers who were accustomed to eating out would flinch at the much higher prices and either eat at home or go to a neighboring town. The end result would be closed restaurants in the town and fewer jobs. Of course with a much smaller raise in the minimum wage in the town, the effect would likely be lost in the standard noise of restaurants closing and opening but the effect would still 	jbuzbee	8.532895	6.201379	comment	9.0	37.0	1496601838	3.8834865

I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it's really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. 	habosa	8.685383	6.406753	comment	9.0	188.0	1613731669	4.1222486

I don't understand how practices like that are legal - then again, small restaurant owners have other things to worry about than fighting a 5, 8, maybe 10 year trademark battle against huge tech companies.

38786138	Perhaps Yum Brands has the data to b	Perhaps Yum Brands has the data to back this up, but it seems quite a silly response that feels more political/ideological than based on sound economics.BIL was COO of a pizza chain. The cost for a large pizza was around $1.50 - even for pricey toppings and gluten free bread. Labor is cheap at ~60 seconds per pie. Biggest costs was rent. A $5 raise could be absorbed across and then some with a 10¢ increase in price or adding an extra $1 delivery fee.Strategically this makes little sense. A key factor of chain pizza’s business model is convenience & cost rather than quality. When faced with the inconvenience of not having delivery available or the extra cost associated with third party delivery services I wonder how many people will just opt for Dominos, Papa Johns or something else?	doctornoble	8.475511	6.3056855	comment	9.0	58.0	1703708090	11.261716

They are expensive and make terrible coffee and they are designed to do one thing only: to lock you into the pods which are very high markup and have negative externalities because they go straight to landfill etc.If you want a coffee machine and don't want to spend a lot, I implore you buy something made for making great coffee like an Aeropress[1].  You can also do worse than say a chemex[2] or a French press/cafetiere[3]. Then when you can afford it buy a nice grinder[4]. Aeropress in particular is really cheap to buy, really easy to make coffee and clean afterwards and makes fantastic coffee.[1] https://aeropress.com/[2] or other drip maker but chemex is a classic. https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/[3] I don't know what brand mine is because it was a	seanhunter	7.7984176	6.301908	comment	10.0	67.0	1673286897	-7.769243

That mouth-watering Pizza Hut pie you remember from 1992 isn't all nostalgia—every now and then I find single-location or small-chain joints that make pizza very similar to how I remember those tasting. Thing is, those are like $15+ a pie now, with a coupon or special. But you can still get larges for $8 or less (coupon or special, which are available 100% of the time) at the major chains—they're just not the same pizza you were getting in the 80s up to about the late 90s.[EDIT] In fact, the 2020-on inflation is the first time I'	yamtaddle	8.421945	6.302886	comment	10.0	134.0	1673464876	11.298779

34459341	Make no mistake, tipping continues i	Make no mistake, tipping continues in America because most Americans like the system. If you don't like to tip, there are plenty of restaurants where tipping isn't expected; specifically those where you carry the food yourself from the counter to your table.  If enough people hated tipping, restaurants that don't have tipping would eventually out-compete those that do.  They may yet do so, but presently most of the public seems okay with tipping.Anecdotally, the culture gap between America and Europe when it comes to obligatory tipping is wider than the issue of tipping.   Americans seem to generally value superficial pleasantness more than Europeans do.  If a waitress in America is having a bad day, people still expect her to put on a pleasant face for the customers, while in Europe peopl	LarryMullins	8.53135	7.0393195	comment	10.0	47.0	1674246371	-15.288527

I’ve been there a few times (though it’s been a while), and I never was impressed.It just seemed like an overpriced, overcrowded version of every other American chain that couldn’t really figure out what it wanted to specialize in [1], so it just offered everything. The “serve everything” food chain seems to be an overcrowded space in the US.Maybe I’m in the minority, but I never really understood the appeal.1. Besides cheesecake, but I don’t think that many people really go there for cheesecake. Most people are usually too full for dessert at restaurants like this.	jader201	8.305769	6.1198974	comment	10.0	35.0	1690514247	11.422542

Subway is the same thing, with most sandwiches topping $10/ea and totals coming out around $50 for four of us.What is interesting, however, is that we're not witnessing this with traditional restaurants and/or fast casual spots.

With 40% margins, that's 200k and assumes you have no employees which seems unlikely given the number of machines.Perhaps I'm way off though, since my perception is probably skewed by tech companies.

That could mean something as innocuous as performing a pasteurization cycle during the day (because it failed to run at night for some reason, perhaps the machine's clock is set wrong). It could also mean there is a physical problem with some part of the machine. The word ""broken"" implies the latter, but I'm pretty sure the former situation is far more common.In other words, the machine has determined it's unsafe to serve the contents (because soft serve needs to be pasteurized at certain intervals), not that it's physically incapable of doing so. Therefore it's ""broken"".(Disclaimer: I've never used one of these soft serve machines,"	tfvlrue	8.326519	6.1991615	comment	10.0	81.0	1646237310	-1.020035

Hire less wait staff as a portion are now are underutilized. Now some wait staff have no jobs, and the remainder work the same exhausting shifts. The reason these wait staff get tips is because they work so hard, with less service comes less tips. Now you have a whole industry of overworked AND underpaid staff.Any efficiencies you are seeing will be refactored and stretched out as any business cannot afford to carry fat if they want maximum profit and competitive edge (price).This whole inconvenience of a friend going to the bathroom is an incredibly weak argument for foregoing the tradition and ceremony of interacting with a person who will provide you with a meal.

The most common complaint at first was cooking smell, so the tiny cafe is forced to install expensive filtration exhaust.Then the complaints turned to signage. A city inspector showed up numerous times to measure his sign, how far his little sandwich board was placed in the sidewalk out front, the brightness of the lights on his sign, that the artwork on the sandwich board was offensive or violated one of the thousands of regulations regarding public advertising.

Turns out that in the middle ages, pizza was just round bread. Not remotely resembling anything we today would consider pizza.Pizza with toppings was apparently invented after the unification of Italy in the 19th century, when someone created three flat pizzas with different sets of toppings. The most popular one was named after the new queen of Italy.And it was mostly Italian immigrants to the US who remembered this and started experimenting with more pizza styles. When they returned to Italy in WW2, they were surprised not to find any pizzas there, and local Italians quickly started making and inventing pizzas for these Americans.	mcv	8.338806	6.2801666	comment	10.0	88.0	1679591780	11.352453

Then I put it in the oven at 300 °C for around 10 minutes. Doesn't produce perfectly charred pizza but comes a lot closer to what you can achieve with a real pizza oven.

Talking about coffee varieties, roasting, grinding still makes some sense, but these microgram-level scales, calling a stupid plastic funnel ""the Hario® v60"" and the other one the AeroPress™ (1) sometimes make me want to give up coffee, just to avoid having a common experience with those people. 
I can make coffee in a hundred different ways, one of which is putting the damn sieve on top of the cup and pouring hot water on it. The other: mix a spoonful of coffee and a cup of water and boil the damn thing.  All the ways come out perfectly fine. How many layers of complexity can you add to something so simple.(1) yeah, that one's more like a syringe than a funnel."	throw_pm23	7.7720504	6.306446	comment	11.0	51.0	1677274994	-7.762042

If that's the case, they needed to be serving consumers not businesses.The concept of food that's uniquely tagged and tracked from origin to consumption is pretty attractive - makes contamination a breeze to trace back, keeps you from cooking with rotten food since the machine knows to reject it, and it could automatically track what you've got in your kitchen to suggest recipes / restock for you.That's all been thought of before, the trouble is how on earth do you build that network? I suspect the reason Juicero got so much money is they were trying to build it first with high end luxury foods, and then expand down-market to eventually own the 'groceries of the future.'Personally, I think good ol Je	nickparker	7.894994	6.144466	comment	11.0	134.0	1504291991	-12.22881

I talk to a human, tell them my order, they repeat it back to me, and tell me it will be X dollars and ready at Y o'clock. I show up at the specified time and the order is ready to go. A couple times I had to wait 5 minutes because they were inundated and couldn't keep up.No stupid app to download. No account to create. No bullshit fees. No marketing emails. I just tell them what I want and then go get it. It's refreshing.	noelsusman	8.550068	6.2999635	comment	12.0	67.0	1591152430	4.133656

That's more than an $11 billion annual incentive to bring robochefs to retail. And that's just fast food, just in the US.Robo janitors may take a bit longer. Maybe they can design automated kitchens that work like jumbo dish washers. Seal, flood, heat, drain, reopen. The janitors could take the form of underwater scrubbing drones.Put the kitchen in a shipping container that plugs into the restaurant. When it breaks swap it out for a refurbished one and haul it back to the repair center.

Ice cream, as a food that is very close to neutral in pH and without much in the way of preservatives, is a common source of listeria bacteria. To prevent serious health issues, the machine must be sanitized regularly. As I understand it, the process is involved, and any given McDonalds may not have a person with the time and skills to complete it.

This might not be a super hard problem in general, but if you're running your own restaurant, the cost of building and maintaining a website with good SEO can be relatively high. Seamless, on the other hand, does nothing but focus on problem areas like building SEO-optimal landing pages for restaurants.

As it often happens here, everyone will swear by its pretty small and obscure ""favorite place"", but they are masters without doubt ;)The dough recipe from the article is pretty legit and exactly the way I do it at home; the main problem I see is that it would be pretty hard to find good Mozzarella or Fiordilatte cheese (Fiordilatte di Agerola is slightly drier than Mozzarella, therefore producing less liquid in the oven, and also costs less), and I find that pizza done according to the Neapolitan recipe loses much when using a different kind of cheese.A pet peeve of mine is that many recipes, while getting most of it right, use instant yeast; an important part of Neapolitan pizza is the slow dough rise using ver"	albmoriconi	8.310405	6.2580357	comment	12.0	86.0	1587732274	11.348753
22968715	I can't speak to pizza, but I have a	I can't speak to pizza, but I have an espresso story to tell.One of my favorite things about going to Italy is the quality of the coffee.  I really like extreme dark roast (your typical American diner coffee doesn't even count as coffee in my book).  In Italy you can go into pretty much any coffee shop and come away with a top-quality espresso.  (Don't even get me started on Starbucks.)  It's a taste I inherited from my parents, who have European roots.Now, my parents are seriously old-school.  They still live in the house I grew up in, a house they bought new in 1975 and pretty much never updated.  It still has the original flower-pattern wall paper.  Walking into their house today feels like stepping into a time machine that transports you to an episode of the Brady Bunch.

23162542	What frustrates me with restaurants 	What frustrates me with restaurants (especially the small business mom and pop ones) is that they are not adapting to this situation.  When I go to their websites (sometimes they don't even have one), I want to see two things:*  A way to order and pay online.*  Details on their contactless pickup procedure if I drive there.  I want them to bring it to my car, then I can unlock my trunk, and they can place it inside and close it.If they did this, my use of these food delivery apps would drop to almost zero.  I don't mind driving to pickup my food, it's even good for my car which has been sitting idle for weeks.  But I want it to be contactless pickup.  If bringing it to my car is too hard, I might even be ok with waiting outside their restaurant, text them, and they bring it out and place i	bit_logic	8.602256	6.3303523	comment	12.0	109.0	1589334555	4.1061873

But if we DoorDash, the tip goes to DoorDash, not the restaurant I want to support.I generally try to order either curbside or delivery through the restaurant's own site. I figure even if they use a third party then, they're using the one most advantageous to their business.I want my favorite restaurants to survive this pandemic, but I couldn't care less about these delivery startups.	ocdtrekkie	8.611522	6.4064035	comment	12.0	94.0	1589564341	-15.106424

If restaurants put any effort at all into fixing those things, there would not be such a strong demand for apps.Obviously this is different for different restaurants, and the skill set needed to run a restaurant is vastly different from running an e-commerce site, but just like they need to figure out how to do taxes and read lease agreements, online presence is a necessary thing in 2020.	orev	8.533032	6.280353	comment	12.0	65.0	1589644842	4.148686

I’m assuming waiting for a job is not active time right?> These new regulations will force us to raise fees for orders in New York City. In order to better balance the impact of these new costs, we’re moving the option to tip in the DoorDash app to after checkout.So hiding the tip until after closing the sale to pretend the total price is cheaper? Very classy.What’s funny is that the tip should come after the service is complete if it’s actually a tip for good service (otherwise how did you know what service you got?). But they’re clearly just trying to hide the true price.	koolba	8.602322	6.921707	comment	12.0	74.0	1701721797	-15.26002

If you're ""forced"" to tip, then it's not a tip anymore.The concept of tipping, at least in Switzerland, has always been to show gratitude for an *exceptional* service. 
I totally understand the situation in the States, where the tip is basically the employee's wage - but this shouldn't be the case to begin with.It shouldn't be considered rude to not tip the service was good / OK.  Employees / waiters should be paid adequate wages regardless of their tips - in the end this is why the food in a restaurant is so expensive (compared to cooking at home)."	denysvitali	8.529151	7.0419097	comment	13.0	77.0	1699578221	-15.290008

Not only do a save a lot of money but it is a higher quality product.It takes about a half hour of prep so I only do it on weekends. I found a quick crust recipe that doesn't require waiting for hours for the dough to rise [1]. The ingredients are just bread flour, yeast, water, salt, olive oil, and sugar.The toppings and sauce are the most expensive parts. Though I'm sure if I made the sauce from scratch I could shave a dollar but probably not worth the effort.Tip: buying a jar of yeast is MUCH cheaper than the pre-measured packets that only make one pizza. Those are a rip off. A jar is almost the same price and makes 15 pizzas instead of 1.[1] http://allrecipes.com/recipe/20171/quick-and	throwaway2016a	8.350665	6.293714	comment	13.0	62.0	1502808457	11.334834

One of them is practically a useless annoyance, and the other one is part of the experience.Someone in a movie box isn't going to tell you about the movie, or have a conversation about it with you.  They are there to take the most basic info (movie, time) and money, and give you a ticket.  It's also always done thru a thick bit of glass that makes communication sometimes difficult if not painful.On the other hand, the fancy waiter will make recommendations.  Will tell you about other things, and is generally part of the ambiance and experience of eating out.Ho	cbanek	8.521062	6.784047	comment	15.0	174.0	1494616181	3.805848

I find that people who are used to teflon pans like to go up into the medium-high range. Things don't end well up there with cast iron.Also buy a metal spatula. You aren't going to hurt anything, and it will be a more satisfying cooking experience. Plastic + cast iron is just going to leave you with a melted spatula.

The rules of what to tip and when are intentionally vague because it's a sensitive subject.We should move to ""fair pay"", that includes slightly increased prices, and do away with tips for most services.It's so common that tips don't mean what the consumer thinks it means. Restaurants and bars that pool tips and share them with all staff.[1] Restaurant owners that try to keep some tips and only pay out a percentage to the staff.[2] Casinos pool tips too so the dealer doesn't get to keep the money you gave him directly.[3]I get asked for tips at Starbucks. I get asked for tips when I do takeout food from the local restaurant. I get asked for tips at the buffet restaurant.

21072975	My buddy used to work for Lipton. He	My buddy used to work for Lipton. He explained that they use the cheapest grade of tea (dust) available. Also many tea companies mix non-tea additives (fillers) to their tea bags.After hearing this I decided, if it's not full loose leaf, I don't drink it. We found that companies like Elephant Chateau (http://elephantchateau.com) deliver the 3 highest grades of tea direct from Ceylon mountain estates with the option for plant-based pyramid bags (soilon) or a free stainless steel infuser.Bonus, the tea actually tastes like tea and is tasty enough to drink plain unlike Lipton dust. It always funny to hear people promote all the health benefits of tea then turn around and dump 100 grams of sugar into a cup to make it palatable.	roboys	7.7508183	6.1121235	comment	17.0	108.0	1569432470	11.171735

If you check prices between the app and the actual restaurants’ websites, there’s often an extra $2-3 added on for each item on DoorDash (I don’t blame the restaurants). When it’s all said and done, a basic $10 meal ends up being $20+ through DoorDash after the upcharged food items, delivery fee, service fee, and tip.Edit: I do still order through DoorDash when they offer me the occasional coupon, but I rarely order without a substantial discount.

- They charge the restaurant less than 5% total fees
- They charge me 5% - 10% for delivery and processing fees whatever (lets say a minimum of $5 or $10, whichever is higher).Problem is at this rate"	calvinbhai	8.708106	6.4951906	comment	20.0	251.0	1588777861	4.123416

We used to joke that “we lose money on every transaction but make it up in scale.”Takeout and Delivery was one of the last bets the company made. Basically food delivery. The customer service load is huge, the services aren’t really differentiated, and you have to both pay the driver enough for it to be worth it and keep prices low for the consumer to think it’s worth it.Attracting customers on either side of the market means spending money to undercut your competition. As soon as you stop giving free delivery promotions or introductory no-fee periods for restaurants, they can instantly churn with little to no pain. Not to mention reaching small restaurants is incredibly time consuming. Th	tyre	8.556272	6.2777085	comment	21.0	212.0	1594004675	4.407746

Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here.	ramphastidae	8.571732	6.3071	comment	21.0	396.0	1609501410	3.8857718

I have also owned nearly every device invented to make coffee - as I'm sure many others here have - and I've settled on a simple over-the-mug pour-over cone, but mainly because there's no moving parts or tubes to worry about cleaning. I don't even know what ""correct"" pour-over technique is, so I'm basically making bog-standard single-serving drip coffee with store-brand beans, and I couldn't be happier with it.Ultimately I think fancy coffee is the same as fancy beer - it's not about the quality of taste of the thing, but rather it's about tribal membership and signaling. Among certain groups of people, caring deeply about 1% gains in taste value from small changes in coffee preparation or hop blends is a chance to prove your wort"	CptFribble	7.7410717	6.244479	comment	21.0	92.0	1658092855	4.8732934

Sriracha in general is a subset of hot sauces, but nobody thinks of a general case for ketchup--it's just ketchup.  Maybe there are situations where no hot sauce but sriracha will do, but that's much rarer in the US (where Huy Fong dominates the market).2) There are no Fancy Dijon Ketchups.  The food snobs don't have an artisan brand they like better; Heinz is as good as it gets.  It's Andy Warhol's old observation that the President drinks the same Coke that you do, only more so--there are way more niche colas than niche ketchups.	mbg721	8.075771	6.121132	comment	22.0	89.0	1624891700	11.754367

These aren't neighborhood restaurants with average food that are meant for locals that we're talking about here. These are fancy. If you want to eat at 7 pm on Friday, why shouldn't it be more expensive than Tuesday at 5 pm?And if restaurant owners don't want to take advantage, they can always offset it by lowering the food and drink prices slightly the whole week long.

39101543	To me, the Moka pot is always a funn	To me, the Moka pot is always a funny (and reliable) example of design and the many ways people make their own interpretations of it. Ask any friend to describe how, exactly, they make coffee with it. There should only be one way, and everyone is sure that their way is the correct one. Yet, there are so many variations of this, it's crazy. From grind size (more coarse than espresso, less than filter), to grams and fill-level (brush off, or exact measure?), to those still convinced it needs tamping (it does not!). Then temperature (as hot as, gas stove burn-it-with-fire, or slow-build) and even lid philosophy (open while it heats, open after it has started bubbling) — and when to close it off, after the first bubbles, once it's been bubbling, until the water is gone, etc. Also, what beans a	mittermayr	7.812677	6.33116	comment	23.0	145.0	1706004885	-11.1434965

23895524	There's nothing wrong with the taste	There's nothing wrong with the taste of Nespresso (it's a little weak for me, but that's personal preference). The reason why coffee pods are awful and need to die is the sheer, disgusting amount of pointless waste they create. Every single cup of coffee requires a small, non-degradable, hard to recycle piece of plastic. Making coffee with a normal espresso machine is so easy. You can learn how to do it in 5 minutes (not barista quality, but at least as good as Nespresso). If you think that cleaning up the mess from a coffee machine is too much work, you are just lazy.The only benefit I can think of is that you don't need a sink nearby. But in every case where I have seen a Nespresso machine, there is a sink within at most a two minutes walk.	esperent	7.801381	6.307859	comment	24.0	148.0	1595230175	-7.739268

I’ve ordered from them probably 10-15 times and every single time, without fail, they either forget an item or replace an item with another item that I don’t want. This makes the service unusable, because if I’m cooking dinner that night and want to order instacart, there’s a high likelyhood I’ll be missing something crucial for my recepie, meaning I’ll have to go to the store anyway.Not to mention the shady fees. The last time I used instacart, there was a box checked called “service fee”, I clicked on it to see what it was and it said “this $10 charge is optional and helps us keep running instacart”. Meanwhile the tip for your driver box is not checked. I bet a large number of people assume the service fee is the tip, and leave tip blank	clay_the_ripper	8.601515	6.977929	comment	24.0	136.0	1518461504	0.010179863

To me, this is the cheapest and best approach.In fact, even if pour overs require too much work (weighing, timing), then just do drip. But do it with quality coffee.Quality is really about roasting time and date. You don’t want old coffee (anything older than a few weeks isn’t good), and low temp. Dark roast is burnt. It’s not a flavor. It’s used to remove the taste from shitty beans. If you use quality beans you want light to medium. This usually isn’t an option with quality beans anyway.

That appears very unlikely at scale.Hyper-local collaboration between restaurants in delivery that kicks out the app company “middle man” could become a thing.

18242541	Hacker News threads about tipping ar	Hacker News threads about tipping are always rough. US tipping is not complicated. You are being asked to share with a service worker's employer some of the burden of compensating them. The notion that you're rewarding exceptional service is a polite fiction. Depending on where you are, the tip is either expected or it isn't. Unfortunately for the mindset of a typical software developer, there won't be much clarity on this point; you'll have to rely on context clues to determine whether and how much of a tip is expected. You can reasonably withhold a tip from someone who is actively hostile or incompetent, but really all you're doing is making yourself feel better. If payment and the tip is expected up-front, you can either buy into the cost-sharing dynamic of tipping, or you can not.Very 	tptacek	8.532734	7.045	comment	30.0	210.0	1539803011	-15.2884035

30502233	This is cool! As someone who's into 	"This is cool! As someone who's into fine dining, a few thoughts/tips for people starting out:1. Don't go into a michelin level restaurant expecting ""well it's expensive so it should be what I normally eat but better"", think of it as its own category of food, that happens to have a really high buy-in price. Lots more crazy flavors, presentation, exotic ingredients, etc. It's not that it has to be 'better' than the best $12 bbq joint you've ever been to, just different.2. Many very high end restaurants have great lunch deals, which can really cut the price to try them."	showerst	8.444471	6.1705656	comment	30.0	207.0	1646068393	11.332016

Out of towners are obsessed with the BEST slice, but the true measure of NYC's 45 degree greatness is the decent quality following a Poisson distribution. My tip: just travel to any random spot in the five boroughs. First; you will be impressed how close you are to a pizza spot wherever you are. Second: you will be impressed with the slice, and with the variety of people who are good at making it.	billiam	8.380898	6.269602	comment	30.0	198.0	1673467686	11.307941
