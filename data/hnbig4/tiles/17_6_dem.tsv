QR Code has a higher theoretical storage capacity, larger maximum size, and multi-byte data support (rather than limited to alphanumeric), none of which applies to this use case though. It also looks like that Data Matrix may work with a lower contrast than QR Code. Both can be read from any angle.Honestly, purely from a technical standpoint, the biggest arguments for QR Codes is their popularity/adoption, and things like that you can stylize the code itself.Maybe I need to do more research, but on the face of it Data Matrix looks like it is technicall	Someone1234	13.822375	-0.49468753	comment	3.0	11.0	1665027041	13.407953

This reduced an 89×89 code down to 77×77, a 24% reduction in area. If this is roughly the ratio, then Base45-encoding binary data by QR code will yield roughly 17% area savings compared with Base64. (Base45 gets 50% bloat, then 24% shrink = multiple of 1.14; Base64 gets 33% bloat = multiple of 1.33; Base45 / Base64 = 1.14 / 1.33 = 0.83.)[Edit:

ProtonMail actually has some connections to NSA investment firms and some former NSA staff on their board. There could be good explanations here, and there could be bad explanations, however, we don't know the role each of these components play in the larger sum; we can only guess and speculate.In that way, an ambitious project that gives away certificates that were formerly worth a lot of money would be a pretty slick honeypot because now you could stow away private keys and have a copy of most of the encrypted webs certificates to decrypt in-flight communications.	kodah	13.619509	-1.254593	comment	3.0	12.0	1625790216	-11.641595

Let the judge laugh at the ridicule of the case, or worst case scenario comply with the judge's order, which would hopefully give enough time to the targeted person to know they're a target by now and stop using Protonmail altogether (or do it via tor).That's what a responsible host does.

Arguably that was a mistake, or maybe with the whole truth in bold on the front page, people would have flocked less to ProtonMail?

Protonmail encrypts all user emails on the server, which can only be unlocked by the user's password. SMTP and IMAP would require transmitting the password to the server for decryption, which makes it prey to interception a la HushMail [0]. This is why they have the bridge, which runs its own IMAP server on the client and performs all authentication and decryption locally.

I can see JMAP becoming a great standard for email-oriented client/server communications.That said, I'd still encourage you to think bigger to make a more general system. Of course, the risk of thinking bigger is you may end up with either nothing or a monstrosity no one wants to use. And also you'd likely have to adapt your business model eventually if the bigger picture changes through your actions. So, it's fair to think smaller too.From a related post I made to the Thunderbird Planning list in April 2017 on what I see as the bigger picture: https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/tb-planning/2017-April/00...

This makes scanning the QR code more difficult due to the smaller dot size. This results in people huddling around a single point at a door for longer and closer proximity.A little tech love such as using short URL’s with an intermediate backend that redirects to the complex site URL with a dozen query parameters would allow much lower resolution (lower version) QR codes that can be scanned faster and/or from a further distance away resulting in better health outcomes. Or at least minimise the negative health outcome from the scanning process.	dhsysusbsjsi	13.817585	-0.51261514	comment	3.0	17.0	1632907509	13.404963

While the advanced search tools are excellent, the results are lousy. Email that I know exists is often unfindable until I force Thunderbird to re-index my whole mailbox.Seeing F/OSS devs of (what I consider to be) a critical app like Thunderbird talk about ""modernizing the interface"" is the worst.

These tools do not integrate with anything; in the case of Stalwart (the only JMAP server not in ""experimental"" status) you can't just install a JMAP server attached to an existing email service; you have to hand it complete control of everything, even unto the on-disk storage of mail.  This is a complete non-starter for any email service outside of hobby/personal hosting.In other words, even if someone wanted to make JMAP available to their users, they'd have to tear the whole thing down and rebuild it in JMAP's image, and the tools available to do so are not fully-featured or integratable enough to do so."	stonogo	13.625977	-1.272823	comment	3.0	12.0	1685472195	-11.972071

It's a bad spec.We had our own IMAP server implementation and had all sorts of problems even between different versions of outlook.Each project had an inbox which you could cc in, resulting in huge inboxes (for the 2000s at least). You could also drag and drop an email you'd received into the project folder to share it with colleagues. And we had mysterious disappearing emails, but only at some clients.One (of the many) problems I remember is that messages could have an ID, but the spec declared that it could change between sessions, so one version of outlook stored that in a short uint (max 65535) because why would you need more for a temporary id.

If they could design QR code menus like responsive mobile sites inspired by food-ordering apps this wouldn't be an issue, they'd be even better than paper menus.When I was in China I enjoyed using their mobile menus.
A common layout I saw was a narrow vertical bar on the left with categories(appetizers, main, drinks, etc) and cards with photos + details on the right.https://www.smartshanghai.com/uploads/articles/2019/06/63615..."	neither_color	13.817044	-0.45500204	comment	4.0	15.0	1624941477	13.369771

IIRC there's a law here that mandates a menu visible from outside the premises, it isn't always followed to the letter, but but most places comply, and it's a great way to avoid unpleasant pricing surprises.Same with paying. You don't accept cash or credit cards? Goodbye. You only accept apple pay or some other nonsense payment system? Goodbye. And you'd better advertise your accepted payment methods outside if you want to avoid unpleasant surprises.There are plenty of restaurants/bars out there. I'm not spending money in any place that clearly doesn't want me there.And if you really insist on a silly QR menu, then at least include a human readable version of the URL. Seriously.

The fax can fail, and so can the minimum wage employees who may or may not be tasked with updating booking.com's systems.Bottom line is always confirm, and re-confirm when the consequences are great enough to warrant spending time re-c	lotsofpulp	13.592941	-0.38409883	comment	4.0	16.0	1537796622	4.2005367

Email clients were designed for a whole different era, and only work well in that context.Gmail, Outlook.com/O365/etc, are designed for you to ""keep everything."" Problem is that all desktop email clients aren't designed that way, they want you to have a very small limited subset of email that they can index and constantly have in memory.When these two worlds converge desktop clients choke and choke hard. Outlook is so terrible that it almost needs to be completely retired. They've barely updated it in ten years.Best case scenario right now is full webmail (with anyone) and browser notifications for new email etc if you need that."

Yet they just aren't included in the base OS (or weren't always, my lineage OS has a flashlight currently). Therefore, they offer very low hanging fruit(super simple app, one can hardly ask money for it, so how does one make money?)I heard from a friend that iOS has TOTP and indeed a barcode scanner build in, same goes for cal/carddav.

For single node setups, RocksDB has been replaced with SQLite with the option of using LiteStream for replication. For larger, distributed setups, support for FoundationDB was added, letting you scale to millions of users without sacrificing performance.

As a result, I've spent a lot of time investigating ways to scan these barcodes with a phone camera in a cross-browser webpage.Ultimately, after much experimentation, the unavoidable conclusion is that the optical scanning solutions are junk. Connecting a crappy $20 HID bluetooth barcode scanner to a phone is so crazily better at scanning a 1D barcode than even the most massaged optical barcode scanning libraries. Industry workers that deal with these barcodes don't even bother with phone camera scanning, it's way too slow and temperamental.	mfrisbie	13.724552	-0.4570214	comment	4.0	18.0	1705432310	13.412567

But proton mail recently changed and requires SMS or another email now, I believe they say it is to combat bots.I tried tutanota but it refuses to create an account at all over a VPN, or at least the VPNs I've used. At least it told me the reason it was a no go here instead of silently failing.Anyone have any recommendations in this space?	ridgered4	13.685465	-1.267408	comment	4.0	15.0	1661427827	-11.636825

Granted I’ve been living far from DC for 20 years, but I spent a large chunk of this summer there. Access to public restrooms was the same as it is here in Seattle: only a problem if you’re a street critter. People who can scan QR codes already have plenty of access to restrooms, they just need to at least suggest they’ll buy something. Homeless people and people barely making ends meet need to be able to use a restroom, and they shouldn’t need a smartphone to do that.	eyelidlessness	13.7936	-0.4464424	comment	4.0	26.0	1661656267	13.382166

There's the original, and the copy that gets printed out on the other end.

But since this could confuse clients that are sending inflight requests, you can't start translating from the new shifted-down-by-one numbers until you've told your clients about it, which could take a theoretically unbounded amount of time.One implementation of this I've seen is to get a list of every UID in a mailbox at tim"	Felz	13.631933	-1.2923883	comment	4.0	21.0	1572262221	-11.926149

I only stopped using it - years after the developers stopped updating it - because I was worried about a future OS update breaking it.Does Thunderbird or any other mail client do this?

This is still a problem and to mince words over the difference between ""voluntarily"" versus ""when ordered"" is dodging the crux of the complaint: Protonmail is not unconditionally private to law enforcement, and so, it is not actually private at all.It's not impossible to make Protonmail less private, provided there are extenuating circumstances, therefore we know there are controls in place to selectively reduce the supposed privacy that may exist under certain typical use cases.The primary dishonesty here (in this blog post) is to imagine that the reader would think it would be probable for Protonmail to ""volunteer"" user data to law enforcement.

20495032	On the topic of generating QR codes 	On the topic of generating QR codes with JavaScript, I have a project that requires generating QR codes and the various libraries I could find all seemed to be rather... poor. A lot of them were simply made for another era of JavaScript, where the only way to generate the image was to set up a table, or even implement its own png encoder(?). There were a few more modern ones, with active development, but the changelogs weren't terrible re-assuring as they were mostly fixing bugs that really shouldn't happen in a standards compliant code generator.In the end I settled on Project Nayuki's QR code library[0]. The JavaScript is targeting ECMAScript 5, but is commented really well so it's not too difficult to refactor it into ES6+.

It was remarkably good from a sysadmin's perspective:- the config system mostly used the name of a directory where lots of software would use a filename (qmail.ini => /var/qmail/conf), the name of a file where other software would use a variable name, and the contents of the file as the value of the variable. This is really, really easy to read and write without writing a parsing library.- separate executables do separate jobs, with well-documented interfaces between them. Oh, and if a part didn't need root, it didn't run as root, and if a part didn't need to be the same user as another, it didn't share users. While it was easiest to replace something at the edge of the graph, it was entirely possible to replace middle jobs as well.- qmail was the original	dsr_	13.66676	-1.1611719	comment	4.0	16.0	1566341189	5.344882

By default this means the day and month of birth and your initials, unless you share those among many other citizens. In that case, more data may be added, such as your full first name or year of birth.While the amount of personal data exposed through the QR code is small and not a privacy risk in my opinion, it does have some points where it can improve.

I think that's probably worse from a country level.Encrypted email is a bad way to do private communication - services that pretend otherwise set off alarms for me.The main advantage of Fastmail vs. Google is that it's a separate service focused on providing you a good experience with custom domain support. The business model is not ad driven so incentives are more aligned and it lets you leave Google services.The privacy people's faith in proton is misplaced (imo).	fossuser	13.58247	-1.2521222	comment	5.0	18.0	1624634551	-11.626272

I can pinch zoom rather than squint at a menu with small/unreadable fonts in dim lighting. I don't need to badger the already exhausted wait staff on a busy night when they forget to drop us a menu or two. When orders are taken online, rather than awkwardly force a friend to not go to the bathroom (or take their kid to the bathroom) until a server can take their order, they can just order and then go. I do think restaurants should handle payment themselves and have the option for paper menus or menus posted on a wall if needed, but otherwise I'm a fan.

On a default Android device you have to click 7 or 8 times to get into the QR scanner thingy inside Google Lens. I carry a 2nd phone with WeChat and I can scan things in 0 seconds flat, but most people don't have it around here in the US.And then many restaurants' QR menus just redirect you to their website with a terrible experience, and sometimes no pictures.And then it's annoying as hell to try to read a phone screen in daylight outdoors.If you can print a QR menu just print the damn menu also. Put the QR code on the menu cover for people who really want that.These days I often just ask wait staff what they have because I don't want to look at my phone.	dheera	13.800233	-0.48944798	comment	5.0	42.0	1624945701	13.387125
27676830	My big issue, which should be easily	My big issue, which should be easily correctable, is that every menu QR code I've scanned results in a PDF that I have to download.Nobody wants PDFs. On desktop sites, it's common to add a (PDF Warning) to links that lead to PDFs.And on a phone, PDFs are even worse. They're almost always sized for the desktop, which means you have to pinch and scroll to see anything, and I don't download stuff from Firefox often enough to know how to find and delete the menus for every single restaurant I eat at.If the menu QR code led to a responsive website, I'd be fine with it. When the QR code leads to a PDF, it makes me angry. If the QR code led to an app I had to install, I'd walk directly out of the restaurant.	thomascgalvin	13.8158455	-0.47994006	comment	5.0	21.0	1624979099	13.373639

I would prefer to see the limitations of IMAP addressed with a few carefully written extensions to the spec - which is already extensible and has a thriving set of useful extensions in the wild.By no means is IMAP a particularly good protocol, but it is extremely broadly supported and designed more with email in mind than JMAP appears to be, which seems to focus more on bringing shiny web tech to email regardless o	Sir_Cmpwn	13.615056	-1.2741803	comment	5.0	68.0	1566017832	-11.972079

I trust Mozilla, and would gladly pay them for that service (I would use Freedome, but afaik they don't support Linux). However, it would have to be usable outside of my browser.Tangentually, I wish Mozilla also offered paid email (or email with a premium plan), which is another service that requires a lot of trust. It would help provide alternative sources of income to keep Firefox alive, and Thunderbird could be a stunningly good email client if they had more resources to pour into it.Mozilla's product is trust and control. Although they are non-profit, I see no issue with them offering paid services.	sha666sum	13.626768	-1.4092846	comment	5.0	60.0	1568124630	4.976888

I've been spending quite a lot of time trying to minimise the number of faxes we send and receive but there's only so far I can go.Email and fax-to-email services are generally frowned upon by the relevant medical accreditation boards, as they consider these to be insecure unless PGP is used. Email addresses have the ease of use and interoperability that fax numbers have, but PGP throws that right out the window.Beyond the technical discussion, I remember reading that fax is considered ""secure"" from a regulatory/legal standpoint because fax lines are subject to wiretapping laws just as a regular phone line is. An email however, sent in plain text, can be legally read by anyone along the line who has the authority to do so. No surprise"	cknight	13.600803	-0.41148344	comment	5.0	22.0	1542617327	13.607352

Any E2EE service that has a webapp is susceptible to this, and that's essentially all E2EE services out there.The only way to address this point, with current technology and current standards, is to discontinue the webapp and force everybody to the native apps on desktop and mobile. It is the opinion of almost everybody in the industry that webapps are necessary, and that's why we, WhatsApp, etc, all provide webapps.So the point is acknowledged (and has always been acknowledged), but the opinion being expressed (remove the webapp) is not something that we agree with.	protonmail	13.669882	-1.2827983	comment	5.0	17.0	1542803963	-11.656773

15964154	Thanks for not letting Thunderbird d	Thanks for not letting Thunderbird die. In my opinion it's still the best and most customizable opensource email client and there is just not a viable replacement.Most of the open source email clients I have tested require you to run a local webserver and access the mail using a web browser with very limited features. All I want/need is a desktop app that can be customized to work similar to Gmail, pulls and deletes emails from remote SMTP/IMAP servers and allows me to create backups locally.Thunderbird gives me that.	sebastian	13.530903	-1.2785491	comment	6.0	40.0	1513716784	4.818401

Then merge Enigmail into core or make SMIME easy to use or get some Rust code in. The ultra-portable mailer? Then port it to Android and iOS. The super-flexible mailer?

I can't see this one becoming popular, given how many are printed on glossy / dirty paper (often using black and white printers as well). I am amazed though how well the standard QR code works in most cases, even with everyone adding an icon in the middle of it (and basically removing error correcting redundancy).An interesting QR thing I picked up last time I was there is how circular QR codes are becoming more popular, see e.g. https://irf.fhnw.ch/bitstream/handle/11654/1788	Macuyiko	13.801362	-0.47133973	comment	6.0	26.0	1542737207	13.423104

When there are network issues, this library returns errors to email clients.Unfortunately, there are hundreds of email clients, and some email clients don’t handle errors properly, and this leads to desynchronization.Our error tracking shows this does not happen often (1-2% of Bridge users) and the symptom is usually incorrect	bartbutler	13.668803	-1.2839088	comment	7.0	30.0	1667416032	-11.661224

I know I sound like a broken record [1] but, at minimum, I believe Thunderbird could take quite a few users (who prefer privacy-focused apps) from both Google and Microsoft (not to mention 3rd-party apps [2] [3] [4]) by integrating functionality at the local level. This would be a considerable (IMO) differentiation in functionality. I will continue to use Outlook until there is a significant justification to switch to Thunderbird.

I think it could be neat as a way to transfer a recipe to an oven, or specific washing instructions to a washing machine for particular items of clothing.

It's entirely open source (GPL), written in JavaScript, syncs mail locally, etc. It essentially -is- what the author of the post is looking to build, except it doesn't look like Thunderbird.

Here are the pros I can come up with off the top of my head:- Restaurants can experiment with more food options and more frequent updates to their menu- Real time info on what's in stock- Cuts out the cost of having to constantly reprint the menu- Easier for customers to find the menu online when searching for restaurants (huge issue pre-COVID)What are the actual downsides? Sure, there may be a tiny fraction of people without a smartphone, but they're likely accompanied by someone who does have one. Despite that, restaurants would likely keep a few physical menus on-hand.	sxg	13.815718	-0.4436458	comment	9.0	48.0	1692889278	13.31083

For GUI mail clients I tend to swing between evolution and claws.  Evolution does all the fancy stuff (html e-mail, seemless integration of calendar invites, outlook support) way better than Thunderbird and claws does all the workhorse stuff way better than Thunderbird (flexible mail fitering, organization,  &c.).Meanwhile Thunderbird has corrupted my inbox 3 times in a sum total of about 3 years of me using it spread out over a decade, crashes more than evolution, and does the core messaging features worse than claws.	aidenn0	13.611992	-1.2667572	comment	9.0	27.0	1604610728	5.0086985

34726506	Unfortunately, at least for me, I've	Unfortunately, at least for me, I've had to mostly switch away from Thunderbird. It has becoming rather frustratingly slow. For example, if I archive an email, it takes 10 to 15 seconds for this to be reflected in the interface. When I have 50 or so emails to deal with, this adds up to a surprising amount of time, and becomes rather frustrating. (I suspect having large volumes of email is part of the issue.)On the much needed feature side of things, other email clients have the very useful feature of showing the complete conversation history (across all accounts) in a sidebar. This alone has been a compelling reason to switch email clients, though, the real reason I switched was the extremely slow interface.I sincerely hope these changes will make Thunderbird usable for me again.	boplicity	13.582522	-1.2658845	comment	10.0	77.0	1675960128	5.005396

The notmuch tag database is not a standard IMAP concept, so syncing your IMAP directories wouldn't sync your tags, and moving from one machine to another required extra work. mu by contrast just does the normal IMAP thing, so you sync the IMAP on one machine, and all your other machines can read the IMAP data, and that's it.I've been using mu for years, and it's fantastic.

They've been promising U2F (a pretty standard security feature) for years, yet there is still no sign of it in this release. They've spent years obsessing over calendars for some reason instead of their core product. They also took a very long time to open source their IMAP bridge which caused me to further lose love for them.PM also blatantly lie in their advertising. They cannot provide end-to-end encrypted mail because limitations in existing email protocols prevent it.

If you are going to eat out, then it is (at least with the people i know) considered ab-so-lu-tely rude to even get your phone out (unless you are an doctor on call), using it would be a totally no-go.

I have had nothing but bad experiences with them.First of, on Android, the camera doesn't magically scan the QR code. You have to download a separate QR code scanner app for that. My wife and my parents all have Android phones and have no idea what to do when they see a QR code like that. The waiter usually just says ""point your camera to it"" because apparently everyone in the world assumes you have an iPhone and that's how it works there. When it doesn't work the waiter now has to do tech support on a random person's phone.Second, as others have said, the social aspect of looking at it together is totally lost. Which is quite big IMHO.Third, scrolling through a PDF or a page on a tiny screen makes it much harder "	binwiederhier	13.806572	-0.48061654	comment	11.0	112.0	1667085258	13.385991

In fact, I often prefer to leave it in the car.* In my area (rural America), a lot of businesses have really poor websites (noticeably worse than urban areas). Nearly all of the QR menus are down right terrible.* There's a good chance some one thought it'd be great to have a bunch of collapsed sections and add a terrible animation. I need to manually expand each section and deal with the terrible animation repositioning the screen.* For those less tech savvy businesses, they probably just uploaded a PDF of their menu. Bonus points if the menu is scanned in on their 15 year old printer/scanner combo.* Finally, there's the group of restaurants 	SkyPuncher	13.814946	-0.45829517	comment	11.0	39.0	1667094136	13.331589

My advice to anyone who wants secure email: don't use protonmail.The email search is completely useless. I don't understand how it can possibly be so difficult to do a substring search on a corpus and rank them in some kind of sane way. Searching for old emails based on content is an exercise in futility. After a few years of using an email service, search becomes really important.It is exceedingly difficult to pull data out. You need dev ops skills to do it.They charge for users that are disabled, and you can only stop paying for them if all of the associated data is deleted.So they effectively hold your data hostage (yes, you can get it out but it time-consuming and requires technical skills).I finally bit the bullet and paid a dev op	cowpig	13.584531	-1.2674047	comment	12.0	106.0	1622308905	-11.664984

All the social media talk of blacklists, and inquisition tactics from some of upper management is bad for business.I've already gotten emails from clients asking me to change their business google services to something else (anything else in their own words).

However in addition to a link shortener that took you to another page, I wanted users to be able to create a mini website that could host apps. Like you could create a small page that had photos of your business and a menu/ordering app and an ""IM with staff"" app etc.The fancy generator was kind of an added bonus, I always thought the QR codes I'd see around were so dull and unidentifiable! There was very little in traditional QR codes themselves to make them ""human-scannable"", so to speak. A QR codes is essentially a sign; it should have some information in it that you, a person, can parse. A little logo in the middle is weak at best.It failed because I didn't sell it. I needed to sell it. I needed to talk to people. I needed to "	koch	13.815734	-0.50375307	comment	15.0	55.0	1685480028	13.4021

Here I sit with 7 accounts in Thunderbird. Maybe I'm just going to be stuck with eM Client or Outlook and using RDP to check my email.

And operating in ""dark web"" is not helping really - physical HW has to be operated by physical people, both of which can be found by state authorities."	yaris	13.689126	-1.2376443	comment	20.0	129.0	1630938956	-11.644531

This got a lot worse with 102. 102 unfortunately is so low in responsiveness that it's literally quicker for me to open a new tab, load Google Mail (the slowest webmail I'm using) find and(!) read the mail there than switching to the already running Thunderbird and waiting for it to load the new message. It also tends to take pretty long to ""boot"", so most days I just avoid using it entirely now, as leaving it running in the background substantially decreases battery l"	formerly_proven	13.621737	-1.2779704	comment	22.0	152.0	1675957446	4.98654
