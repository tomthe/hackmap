Where does ""wrote integration test for xyz"" fit into the company's ""increase monthly active users by x%"" KR?I think the general trickiness is that OKRs are inherently backward-looking.

I submit that OKRs were handy because they forced formal communication that revealed problems outside the official formal methods. It's a hack.

Strict grading of OKRs is worse than useless.During the year (or quarter), your picture of what's useful and feasible becomes more and more precise. So your OKRs that you wrote at the beginning are worse than your current knowledge of the true goals. It's really bad to cling to your old misconceptions of what was important when you wrote those OKRs.Finally, the desire to quantitative-ize every OKR is beyond harmful. Does your organization really not care about anything qualitative? Well, it shows in your products.

As I’ve moved into larger companies and am shackled by OKRs, I am enjoying my work a lot less and feel under more pressure than ever but am getting less useful work done. It feels like a lack of trust and assumes the organization is run very efficiently and fairly—which I don’t think any company can truly claim. People just seem to adjust by gaming these systems instead of putting useful effort into their work.	spacemadness	15.166354	-0.36758366	comment	4.0	15.0	1651590518	-16.270935

For example, the political goal ""I as CTO want my department to grow by N FTEs so that I will gain in prestige compared to my peers in the C-suite"" is definitely not something you will ever see on an OKR sheet but is definitely something that happens. On the other end of the influence spectrum, ""I want to learn technology X because it will look good on my resume when I job-hop in a year from now"" is also something you can't really use as a reason in a corporate setting but still definitely something that happens all the time.If you cannot start from the real Objectives and have to make up fake ones, determining effective Ke"	WJW	15.171437	-0.36714065	comment	4.0	23.0	1652890833	-16.269049

That's where I learned about them.The book explains how Andy Grove introduced the practice at Intel and it was very effective. The book seems to attribute the success to the practice itself and seems to say ""if you adopt OKRs, you will succeed like Intel did"".I suspect that this success is misattributed. I suspect that Andy Grove was probably an excellent manager and I think he could have succeeded with something other than OKRs. I think he understood that what was really important was to get everybody across the organization to focus on essentially one big goal. He needed to make sure that everybody was pulling in the same direction and together, and OKRs provided a tool to do that.When my organiza"	balefrost	15.170984	-0.36736038	comment	4.0	15.0	1652913027	-16.270359
29234915	One of my issues with OKRs is the of	One of my issues with OKRs is the oft-repeated line that the goals should be so audacious that you should only expect to achieve about 70% of them.If you're following this advice, you are either purposefully choosing goals that you do not know how to achieve, which is a problem, or purposefully choosing goals whose achievement relies on way too many externalities over which you have little control, which is a problem.I'm not saying external factors shouldn't be considered, or that we should only set goals that are within comfortable reach.Rather, I'm saying the uncertainty should be accounted for differently. It should be baked into our goals, not treated as if it only matters at the OKR level.Imagine if you were to plan a sprint, and your story points did not factor in uncertainty at all.	jawns	15.1704645	-0.3670753	comment	5.0	22.0	1637022306	-16.267786

I used to joke that as soon as another team was involved in something you needed to do it would probably take a quarter. why? Well what you wanted probably wasn't on this quarter's OKRs so it would be an uphill battle to get them to do it. You'd have to argue about getting it into next quarter's OKRs;2. OKRs can be structured in such a way that you can grade quite well while having achieved absolutely nothing;3. Teams can be held to different standards. Some get easy OKRs. Some get harder OKRs. So it's still subject to the political-perception problems inherent in such organizations;5. It is largely for show for upper management.

Maybe I'm just dumb or can't grasp it, but while I know what all the words mean, I still don't understand what it is or why it's useful. I'd write some ""OKRs"" based on what my boss told me to write, who was told be their boss, and then I'd enter them into some HR system and never saw or heard from them again. It was all very cargo cult-y.I never really understood how an OKR is at all applicable to an individual. Maybe our OKRs were bad but they were always related to increasing some metric or measure.

Changes to these after the first week of the quarter had to be approved by our managers.Our CEO had the philosophy that if you achieved 100% of your goals every quarter, you weren't being ambitious enough. As a result, we would stop logging progress at ~80% of our goals, which was the threshold to qualify for your bonusHowever, scope on projects would change during a quarter, and sometimes the VP would become distracted by another shiny new thing and make us start on his new pet project.

A lot of organizational time is spent coming up with OKRs only for them to be either overridden due to the reality of running a business (gotta do what clients need, gotta do what you can to compete with competitors) or just by VPs/Directors deciding that something else requires the teams focus. Ultimately it seems like a whole bunch of busy work for PMs and TPMs, to justify their existence and hiring more of them.“But you’re not doing OKRs correctly!” Sure, I agree to that.
