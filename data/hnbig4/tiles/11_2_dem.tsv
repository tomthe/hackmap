It makes a few grand between halloween and new years (https://cheergram.com but the cert is expired rn)Surprisingly, the best thing that I did to get it some traction was having a few influential people in the design/craft community post it to pinterest. A couple years ago, a single pin generated dozens of orders.Other than that, some SEO fu has always helped. It used to be on page 1 for ""Instagram christmas cards"" and I'd get lots of traffic from that (currently on page 2). So, some SEO basics (good titles, good headings, a blog/news section) always helps."	callmeed	6.55363	-5.8042855	comment	3.0	10.0	1476651471	-15.377644

I want to know who made it, see their other work, and find it in its original quality without 15 generations of jpg recompression artifacts.But no, Pinterest has better SEO than the artist does, so it's just endless reposts upon reposts and never the original work.Occasionally you get lucky and it's not the sort of image that Pinterest users share. Then you might actually find where it came from.	wlesieutre	6.5467095	-5.811789	comment	3.0	10.0	1623110020	-15.390792

Even if it may have some of the same surface-level mechanisms (like a personalized feed or share buttons), it is very much _not_ used as a tool to broadcast personal updates, read news, or cultivate relationships among people. The average user treats it much more like a visual search engine with a bookmarking system built into it than a social network.Also, this is a minor quibble, but Pinterest does not have a Like system any longer. I know because I worked on deprecating it.	swalling	6.5502133	-5.8100357	comment	3.0	10.0	1536614720	-15.37905

So Google crawls Pinterest about an order of magnitude more than most other sites.

The Pinterest badge is the exact same stylised letter P from the old wordmark. So, almost everywhere you encounter a Pinterest logo it will be the stylised graphic.

At the same time, people who have taste similar to mine are a much better way to find things than any algorithm Pinterest has ever released.

Namely, that while they should treat all sites equally, in practicality there's not really much incentive to on their part.Think about it. Let's say Google does remove Pinterest altogether, banning the site as a punishment for 'gaming' the system.What then? The people that do search for Pinterest will find it missing, and likely assume Google screwed up/their search engine is broken. They won't know Google banned the site or what for, they'll just think 'Pinterest should be coming up, it isn't, so Google is broken'.And I suspect that underpins a lot of instances where Google gives larger more popular sites and services a slap on the wrist for using black hat SEO.

25538695	Google should be asking from a produ	Google should be asking from a product perspective if they are providing the search results the user is most likely seeking.I seriously doubt that most pinterest results are what users are seeking.  As such, Google probably should consider changes to their algorithm to compensate (cat and mouse) for pinterest's gaming.  That is assuming how pinterest does it is not against any google rules... because if it were against any rules, they should be slapped down hard.When my searches result in mostly pinterest results, I give up more quickly.  That means I spend less time using google, and that in theory means less money for google.  Unfortunately, I do see other more regular user types operate their computers, and they are less or un-descriminating about the domain name listed under the image.	blunte	6.547008	-5.8119607	comment	17.0	161.0	1608927144	-15.392263

I don't even know why Google continues to allow them in the results when there is clear-cut policies around showing something different to the crawler than the user.Ironically, a good workaround is setting your user agent to the Googlebot and suddenly all those modal/nag screens disappear.	tgtweak	6.5483003	-5.811694	comment	18.0	140.0	1624911599	-15.385642
