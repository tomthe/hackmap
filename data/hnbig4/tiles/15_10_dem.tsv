And plenty of people lost that ""best home they could afford"" back then.  Fortunately, I couldn't afford a four-figure car, much less a house - though some other grad students seemed able to convince someone to offer them loans.  No idea how all those worked out, I do hope some of them were able to keep the houses.I know quite a few people who are able to afford their houses, but wish they'd purchased smaller.  A larger house, all other things being equal, will cost more to heat and cool, take more time to clean and maintain, and will generally have far higher carrying costs.  You can mitigate some of them, but they're quite a bit more expensive than something smaller, simpler, and che"	Syonyk	11.241574	3.6997232	comment	3.0	10.0	1664941322	-0.6327018

Permit process is expensive and takes time. Laying utilities is expensive. Paying the myriad of fees is expensive.In one place I lived, the cost of developing a plot of land for single family use was almost $70k, and that was not an expensive state like California.And then mortgage rate hikes have to be considered. Buyers are walking away from contracts and homes being built because rate hikes made the homes unaffordable.Less government is the solution, not more.

Three of the winners for the other offers supposedly had both appraisal gaps and waived inspections.	gullywhumper	11.452411	3.6449378	comment	3.0	14.0	1616437555	-0.4742281

Its this sort of unscrupulous taking, of maximizing profit because its 'leaving money on the table' to not do so, is why we have rent control ordinances which work by capping the maximum yearly % increase in many of our big cities (although this cap is typically higher than the median wage increase so landlords still beat the economy with their investment and with rent control ordinances applied, despite some sentiments online about rent control).	asdff	11.332373	3.8253527	comment	3.0	23.0	1616445091	-0.54575485

Foreign ""investment"". Investment here is a euphemism. ""Money laundering"" is probably closer to the truth. Example: every US tax resident is required to declare all foreign assets (including being a signatory in a foreign company or trust) but... real estate is specifically excluded. Why?

The government, free of the landlord's profit motive, could in turn offer these properties to the public at lower prices through long term mortgages with little to no down payment.

Comparatively, immigrants don’t have the purchasing power to compete, so saying they’re the problem is a weird conclusion to draw.While I bear zero animus towards immigrants, this seems obtuse.

37856362	One big source of apartments being t	One big source of apartments being too expensive to rent is investment companies swooping in to buy apartment buildings, hoping the _building itself_ will appreciate in value, so that they can then sell it later at a profit. In this model, it's actually against the owner's interest to rent apartments because renters inevitably cause damage that needs fixing, which cuts into the owner's bottom line and makes the building less resellable. So, the solution is to charge exorbitant, insane above market rents; a small number of fools with more money than sense will rent at that price, and that will help cover loan interest costs, etc. in the meantime. With enough starting capital, renting to a few tenants at very high prices is a much better investment than renting to many tenants at market rate	nameless912	11.366846	3.816324	comment	3.0	13.0	1697114420	-0.6180951

They are betting that in the future even more people will want that housing, and they are probably right. The only real solution is to crash the housing market by building more houses in places that people want them. Banning speculation won't solve the problem, and it might actually make the problem worse because we will have even less development that people need. We need to heavily update construction regulations to be more sensible like Tokyo, and we probably need massive amount of direct and indirect public housing investments.	zeroCalories	11.159695	3.8127942	comment	3.0	20.0	1697488211	-0.64642024

Simple taxes that are difficult to avoid (such as LVT) are best if you want a progressive tax regime.One of the best features of LVT is that it taxes unearned increases in the value of land. While you can do any improvements you want to the property without increasing the LVT, improvements made by the city or other private interests to the area around your land absolutely will increase its value, thus increasing your tax burden.	chongli	11.388717	3.667004	comment	3.0	25.0	1697511545	-0.68390685

But their local knowledge was invaluable in both buying and selling a home.That said, if a buyer and seller agree on a sale independently of any realtor here, we can go to a local realtor and they'll happily facilitate the sale for a flat fee of around $1000. I've done that once, and had a number of friends who also did so. Most of the realtors recognize that the bulk of their commission comes from the listing and marketing process, and the paperwork is just something they know how to do correctly. $1000 is a fair price for knowing that's all being done correctly and fairly.	japhyr	11.671103	3.6161044	comment	3.0	28.0	1499448345	-11.362773

What confuses many people into thinking that it is is that you often end up holding it for a long period of time, paying down the mortgage and when you go to sell, you have a large gain, where you started with a very small downpayment. For most people, that gain is also tax-free, so it seems like a magic windfall.The problem is that over that long a period of time, inflation may have halved the purchasing power, meaning your gain is a paper one, you spent a lot of years fixing and maintaining the house, paying taxes and insurance, working on the yard, maybe did some remodeling, etc. If you'd instead invested in the stock market any surplus over renting, you often would have come out ahead.Most people"	sokoloff	11.431597	3.5975728	comment	3.0	33.0	1501086763	-0.38572517

Property prices don't reflect their value as places to live and their location, but rather their ability to be a vehicle for investment income. High rent ensues and yet the lower demand for those properties as rentals doesn't deter the property prices from rising. Currently there are a handful of almost completely empty apartment buildings in the CBD.People can't afford to rent or buy them yet they still move about the property market.At some point they will surely come back into circulation at a price that makes sense for individuals, that is of course if they aren't all owned entirely by corporate scale landlords with bigger pockets.	ehnto	11.31238	3.7807922	comment	3.0	18.0	1501300497	-0.5720704

E.g. you just bought a property in Mountain View so your mortgage payments are high, plus the cost of all of the new appliances, and maybe it's an older house so labour and maintenance costs are higher than the $4k/mo you charge in rent.	spoonie	11.366509	3.7640226	comment	3.0	15.0	1477169463	-0.6068237

In this case, since the availability is limited you are allowing a small percentage of the total population (those with outsized buying power) to define what is acceptable.Rent control (alone) just pushes the problem down the road.

I would think ownership provides more stability than renting, but I have no data on whether renters move more or not.	fred_is_fred	11.337082	3.817111	comment	3.0	12.0	1623688214	-0.5855378

It ensures that a person claiming ownership of land makes more productive use of it than the cost of depriving society of use of that land.

It offers better returns than keeping money in the bank and it is safer, especially if you are from a country where your assets could be in danger - it's much harder for foreign states to take control of the property, sell it and recover the monies.Here in the UK we have the same problem. Good percentage of the ruling party (and opposition) are landlords, there is a ton of foreign money coming in buying up properties left and right and they don't even care if they are rented out, because empty property gives good enough return. We even have banks start to move in this business as well.	varispeed	11.379272	3.6808248	comment	3.0	20.0	1680384855	-0.58720875

“The reason is that property values, mortgages and taxes are much lower in downmarket neighbourhoods, but rents aren’t that much lower,” says Desmond.
There are caveats: the relationship is not true in a few top cities, such as New York, but does apply to places like Indianapolis and Buffalo, where “most folks live in America”.

At 6:12 it landed in the ocean.  We know about NK missiles launches very quickly after they are fired.  I wouldn't be surprised if we know about them before they're fired.  This suggests to me that these missiles can be intercepted.I don't know what kinds of interception technology is deployed in the area, but I would guess there is some and I would also guess that a (hypothetical) NK ICBM would not have significant countermeasures.I think the real question here is what NK/Kim's aims are.

Back when I was renting I moved about every 3 years, although that was also house-sharing with other young professionals.Rent is usually more expensive than mortgage payments, and house price appreciation is your only chance to make a leveraged investment that pays roughly 7% annually.Edit: also, obviously, after 20 years you have no more payments.

The premium you pay to rent is in exchange for vastly limiting your exposure to said risk.This is why offloading the risk onto creditors (ie purchasing real estate with borrowed money under an LLC) is so lucrative. You reap all of the rewards of property ownership, but none of the downside. In a failure scenario your creditors are on the hook, not you.I should probably add that banks are not stupid and it is very difficult, but not impossible, to get a loan for real estate investment under an LLC.	billmalarky	11.413083	3.7140696	comment	3.0	44.0	1509036778	-0.5753528
15560754	> This is distinct from a property t	"> This is distinct from a property tax in that it only measures the value of the soil it sits on, so doesn't punish the landlord for improvements. The value of the land itself is almost entirely outside of the landlord's control, it's determined by the community around it. As a result, this is one of the least distortive taxes.When land value is taxed at a higher rate than property value, it creates a perverse incentive for landlords - especially those who don't live in the area in which they own property - to encourage blighting and sabotage the value of the land, while instead reinvesting this money into improvements on the property itself. That concentrates wealth even further in the hands of people who can afford to own these insular properties in otherwise ""undesirable"" areas.Actively"	chimeracoder	11.364802	3.6431184	comment	3.0	11.0	1509037146	-0.64430434
15560855	This comment doesn't stand up to scr	This comment doesn't stand up to scrutiny. There aren't a lot of available statistics on how wealthy landlords are, but for instance, according to a San Francisco property owners survey[1], median income for landlords is $90k, only 15% higher than the overall San Francisco median income ($77k). And of course a software engineer's median income in San Francisco is higher ($92k). Either way, there is little evidence that in one of the hottest real estate markets in the country, landlords would be 'substantially' richer than tenants on average.Of course, income is only a component of wealth--no doubt the property owned is worth quite a bit--but, according to the same report, at least 75% of these landlords are still paying mortgages on their properties, and over 10% spend more than their rent	bmmayer1	11.351239	3.7653732	comment	3.0	20.0	1509037661	-0.5660295

Insurance and security for vacant buildings and especially vacant lots is pennies; certainly much cheaper than for a developed property with tenants.

But they also say “Everything we do is legal!” - and if that’s the case we need better laws and regulation to avoid this type of behavior.

It is a ""the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury"" situation in which the older generations build a political environment around real estate prices always increasing which causes them to increase more consistently and to a larger degree.  The longer that is allowed to persist, the more difficult it becomes to change.

No it doesn't work like that at all.I bought a house at the end of 2020 for $430k with a loan of $337k.I can't borrow more than that now, my real income hasn't increased, I still have the same sorts of liabilities and expenditures that I had then.So even though my house is now worth maybe $700k, if I want to move, I have to find a house that I can buy for $700k.I have paid off something like $20k, so maybe I could find a house for $720k and move into it.Thus the only way I can move into a bigger/better house is to move somewhere that $720k gets you something bigger/better than in my current location.But guess what?

38428416	Real estate is a very high maintenan	Real estate is a very high maintenance investment relative to stocks. The real reason people invest in real estate is because they can walk into a bank and get a low interest rate 30 year loan to buy that investment, which is not going to happen with any other investment class.People also invest in real estate mostly for the land, not the housing. Land is a scarce resource in growing cities. Demand goes up, supply stays the same. Building high density housing actually makes property more expensive, as it can command higher prices from developers.If they just wanted to escape inflation on a pure cash investment, real estate isn’t a great way to do that.

Even to the right person it won't be as much value as you would expect - unless they are putting a more than normal down on the house the bank will then value that at zero and thus not give them a loan for what that feature is worth.Pools are the same thing - should be valuable to the right buyer, but in practice worth zero. Even the most valuable remodels - kitchens - often are worth less than not doing it at all because while it adds a lot of value to the house it doesn't add as much as they cost.	bluGill	11.345153	3.7236261	comment	3.0	11.0	1701226080	-0.5919005

Locations appreciate in value specifically because more humans want to own it.Viewing homes as investments therefore, requires you to steadily make more and more people want your home who are unable to have it.

Trudeau's Federal government recently said that even a 10% correction in housing would be unacceptable.In practice, Canadian housing isn't housing - it's a 30% (or better) government bond that you get to live in or rent out.  That's a 30% return guaranteed by a sovereign state that will gladly destroy everything else in the country to prop up housing.  There is no investment like it anywhere else in the world, which is why Canada is seeing the largest real estate bubble in the world.The best part?

After all the intrinsic value associated with owning the property hasn't changed.My point is how is a buyer better off under this scenario if they would have to pay the same amount per year in order to have a home? In fact they'd be worse off because a mortgage can be paid off but a LVT cannot.  And wouldn't the LVT collapsing housing prices massively reduce the net worth of homeowners?

It's not clear how much of this was caused by Legoland and how much Legoland is just an example of bond market troubles after an unprecedented period of low rates that created unrealistic investor expectations of risk, and the subsequent repricing when rates start to go up. E.g. municipal debt should never be priced the same as federal government debt, because the Federal government is a currency issuer with a central bank, whereas the municipal government 	rsj_hn	12.059228	3.8560753	comment	3.0	10.0	1668718602	-3.7526827

Even if you ignore the substantial amount of work it takes to actually maintain a property, find and deal with tenants, the basic tenets of capitalism still apply:  somebody has to allocate capital in a speculative manner to predict future needs.It is very easy for a landlord to lose their shirt in even conservative investments.  Landlords justify their rate of return due to the financial risk and the cost of capital.  My parents lost a lot of money buying and renting property.  You can lose money due to tenants destroying property, you can lose money due to insufficient occupancy, and you can lose money by the value of the house going down.	jnwatson	11.327135	3.8105342	comment	3.0	15.0	1669449189	-0.5394455

If there are any left, take a look at homes in your area that were built before 1960. Quite a different. It would be illegal today to build the house I first bought, in almost every aspect. But it was a typical mass produced house built around 1970.Secondly, at least in Seattle, the city government regularly heaps more and more expensive burdens on landlords. For example, recently they passed a law that the landlord is financially responsible for damage to an apartment caused by domestic violence. Regardless of your feelings about that, that causes rents to go up. 	WalterBright	11.215879	3.8125944	comment	3.0	10.0	1586379844	-0.67819667

The idea was to help people to afford homes even though they would not normally be considered a good risk.But opening this up created a vast new market, like adding a wider bottom tier to an already giant pyramid. Along with the vast size came even higher risk, since all these people would be more liable to default if the economy tanked.Even still because we are accepting more sub-prime liability, it goes beyond poor people to others with better incomes but are buying into a more expensive neighborhood. Now people of all incomes are getting sub-prime loans, and this feed into rising housing prices.	Isamu	11.429013	3.591844	comment	3.0	14.0	1536678150	-0.4507163

In fact real estate is just as supply-elastic as everything else. New developments open up all the time. Development makes land more attractive for more people. And areas become blighted and therefore less attractive, lowering prices.Some places have sharply-constrained supply, such as San Francisco, but this isn't the norm. The norm is cities slowly expanding outwards, as new investments in the center require more time and effort to bear fruit.

But because it is a near-certainty the real price would go to $5000/month in 5 years - but he is unable to increase rent to that if he rents out today at $3000/month due to rent control (and this is critical) - he would rather keep it vacant until someone comes along and pays the higher amount.If not for rent control, he would charge $3000/month now at market-clearing rates, get a tenant in there in 30 days, and increase rent by the standard market price every 12 months. But due to rent control undercutting profits, he can't do this, so he keeps it open at a higher price.	icelancer	11.405187	3.8303375	comment	3.0	11.0	1515446923	-0.61223394

Most of that unearned cash would flow in to state coffers instead.It's ironic, because the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer foundation (the group behind prop 13) tried to justify prop 13 by saying that raising property taxes would hurt the elderly.

The net hit to your finances is maybe a thousand dollars, or however much a moving truck or a plane ticket costs.When you run out of mortgage money, your home is seized and sold, you will piss away tens of thousands of dollars of equity in foreclosure, realtor, and legal fees. Hundreds of thousands of dollars if you're in a down market, and you go underwater. You'll get to enjoy a ruined credit score... And, on top of that, all the other problems that you face when you can't pay rent.I'd much rather be locked into a $1000/month rent for 30 years, then a $1000/month interest-mortgage for 30 years.	vkou	11.378735	3.6520689	comment	3.0	14.0	1523661898	-0.4973655

A bum is stationary, feeding off of those unfortunate enough to cross his path; a hobo merely travels from town to town, finding work when he can, but only for the sake of financing his next adventure.

The same landlords who profit from the high prices of housing in our urban cores actively oppose new development because of that same reason.We can't solve this problem by banning rent control.

They got a loan to buy the property, and the loan is backed by the revenue potential of the property.  If rents decrease, the revenue potential also decreases and the lenders require the property owners to make up the difference.  It produces a huge incentive for a property to go unrented at a high price rather than rented at a low price.	mark-r	11.320266	3.8053703	comment	3.0	11.0	1588394844	-0.5801179

The benefits to the agent for a lower price is in conflict with what the homeowner wants. For example, a $10K diff in sale price is $350 for the listing agent, and $9650 for the homeowner. So of course agents will push for low prices to get a quick sale.Of course, there are many times that a seller wants a quick sale (moving etc).

This means that the land tax cannot be passed onto the renter, because the market conditions haven't changed. The rent is not calculated based on the landlord's costs plus some extra, but instead is whatever the market equilibrium price is.Another way to think about it: if landlords have the market power to raise rents, why wouldn't they just do it now, rather than wait until an LVT is passed?	neilparikh	11.40397	3.7292657	comment	3.0	11.0	1589747395	-0.5597716

The problem with punishing institutional investors is it would take huge amounts on investment out of the housing market, just as we have a massive need for more housing. We need more houses for people to buy and more new housing available to rent.

The problem is that society tolerates this practice of investors swallowing up housing, pricing people out of the market, and then leaving perfectly those good homes vacant.Couldn't the solution be simply to enact a sufficiently punishing property tax rate on property not owner-occupied for more than 300 days of the year, so that these ""investments"" lose money?

If you put 20% down, that'd be a monthly mortgage payment of $11,500. That's 1/6th of the average Vancouver family's annual income, per month!I have a feeling that if you're paying $11,500 a month on your mortgage, you're not worried about 1% of the value of your house, and you're definitely not worried about renting it out at a profit. You're just hoping it keeps appreciating enough to pay for interest and this new piddly 1% tax.That's who this tax is targeting.

As I grew up and looked into the details, I realized property taxes stick with a property forever.This begs the question. Why buy a house at all? It's not like if you are laid off, disabled or just incapable of finding and keeping a job, you will still have a dwelling to squat and survive in.This makes a house a liability more than an asset (in survival terms, not monetary terms) in my mind.Am I thinking right?

I allocated some capital to some real property, and this real property generates value for me every day, which I might have purchased otherwise (indeed, would have been nearly forced to).  Because of the ability of my home to generate value in this manner, I expect that others might want to own it, and so it can probably be resold.  I also am pretty optimistic about my ability to resell it for more than I bought it for, although perhaps not at such a price such that the purchase was as profitable as, say, buying an Vanguard ETF.	jholman	11.400552	3.6315508	comment	3.0	11.0	1484158660	-0.5181583

The goal seems to be lowering taxes as much as possible until only the bare minimum is left. Proactively maintaining public land is not something people deem important (until it's too late) so that's an easy thing to skip. 'Adopt a highway' is a perfect example of something that, in my opinion, should be taken care of through taxes, but is now the responsibility of good Samaritans.Now this is what it looks like from far away in Europe and I might be completely wrong.	donkeyd	11.246398	3.6437364	comment	3.0	17.0	1572437263	-0.71627104

They benefit from increased housing prices.Further, any countering increase in property taxes is dampened by Prop 13.

When their parents bought their home years ago, the interest rate was very likely 10% or higher. Today it’s 3.5% and even lower.  This drives prices up. The biggest issue is getting a down payment.I believe a combination of lower standard down payments and new mortgage terms of 40-50 years would make housing more attainable for a lot of people.

Public education in the US is a gigantic socialist system. So is health care. You're not comparing a socialist system with a market based system. You're comparing a socialist system with a socialist system - which says nothing about what market system could do.And lastly, who collects those astounding statistics on Cuba?

18841444	I only see real estate as a good inv	"I only see real estate as a good investment two reasons:1. Capital/equity appreciation - the value of the home + land is worth more in the future. This is not a guarantee in most parts of the country. There are a few areas that are fairly resilient (usually within the metro area of the largest cities in the country) but the barrier to entry can be impossibly high for most people.2. Hedge against inflation - the value of your mortgage stays the same, but rents (and, in turn, the value of the dollar) increase. This is the classic ""rent vs buy"" scenario. If rents / sq ft are more in your area than owning the home it's worthwhile. This may not always be the case but even if rents dip they may (will) rise again and the predictability of a mortgage payment over 30 years can offer stability.

I paid a full 3% to the buyer's agent (the buyer's agent actually plays a bigger role in selling your house than your agent), and still saved like $18k.

Then you could work out the logistical details of how it would work, people would get comfortable with it, and then years or decades later you expand it to housing.Part of their proposal relies on a huge mental shift in how we think about housing and property rights, to treat it as a shared public good rather than something any individual owns.  That's the kicker, which realistically would take a few generations as the mental model shift required probably exceeds the capacity for change in anyone over the age of 40.	patja	11.231746	3.6624358	comment	3.0	14.0	1532023094	-0.55981535

If you can't afford to live there then you can't vote for policies that will reduce housing costs there because you aren't a resident. And once you have a vote because you own a house, now you want housing prices to go up rather than down.There is no way for the people who need less expensive housing to vote for it, and the opposite incentive for the people who could vote for it to actually do that.

All without having a hard-line income cutoff for this stuff (which doesn't help when the numbers are out of balance with the local situation). Building housing will hopefully help folks so long as there is a shortage, but it isn't a cure-all either.	Broken_Hippo	11.143919	3.7960367	comment	3.0	14.0	1518188770	-0.66140336

Leaders who for various reasons taunt and provoke each other, implementing what to either populace seems a reasonable policy. (NK would like to be able to defend against the US, so they get nukes. The US would like to not be nuked, so they agitate strongly against them). Alas, these policies are in conflict, so tensions rise.At some point, a small event - a misunderstanding, a border skirmish, etc - happens.

At many points we could have chosen less confrontation, but usually we chose more. Recently we offered Qaddafi the same deal we have continually offered the Kims, and then after he accepted it we ""changed our minds"" and shoved a bayonet up his ass. Even now we continue the pressure (somewhat erratically, because Trump), when doing so has no conceivable ""self-interest"" on a national level. Of course more war is very much in the interest of armaments manufacturers and their sockpuppets in politics and the media. If war were ever in the overall national interest, we'd occasionally win a war or even just accomplish some vague goal by fighting one.

Then the real estate brokerage contacted me and asked to re-negotiate because they figured they had better get something than nothing.

You start with the high rent and then come down as it sits vacant.  Different units in the building with the same amenities might rent for different amounts.If your rent is $2000 and no one will come in, it makes sense to drop your rent to $1850 if it gets someone in now, because at the end of the year you'll break even vs sitting just one extra month vacant at $2000.The main reason that doesn't happen in NYC in particular is rent control/stabilization -- dropping the rent lowers your baseline.In most cities, you can make up that rent with an increase at the end of the year.  But not in NYC.  So landlords are incentivized to keep units empty.	jedberg	11.324496	3.826407	comment	3.0	11.0	1702707273	-0.6136923

In NYC the bribe is more like a few thousand dollars.Public housing is its own problem. It creates de facto ghettos, which is a major reason why locals oppose construction of public housing. It turns out that landlords' financial incentive to screen prospective tenants generally does a good job of weeding out trashy people who destroy the unit and surrounding area.	ceeplusplus	11.311995	3.8511887	comment	3.0	18.0	1656354940	-0.5967234

When my friend asked around it sounded like many founders in the space have encountered this profile of applicant, and many suspect these are people working for the North Korean state.If this is indeed North Koreans trying to get remote jobs, I've been wondering if their game is:

The above numbers are real required profit because of the risk you are taking, and also the time that you own the house paying intrest waiting for the next buyers to take over. There is a different type of flipper who gets into each of the above, getting the wrong house will break you.

Like what we are seeing in this news piece.I don't know exactly how it works here in the Netherlands, but as far as I understand the government leases land to the constructors at its own pace, with strict quotas on social housing, to let vs to buy ratio, and free-market properties. It isn't perfect (massive bubble on the free market right now) but seems to work well enough.	ricardobeat	11.152572	3.8418286	comment	3.0	17.0	1657802385	-0.59978485

This kind of investment provides very little value to consumers, and in my view only serves to extract money from the poor to the rich.	seper8	11.139845	3.897958	comment	3.0	15.0	1660730968	13.497429

These should at the very least be on the rental market.(3) Subject all real estate purchases and investments to KYC/AML and other rules.

In a city where prices are disgustingly high and homelessness is appallingly common, the vacancy rate becomes much more sensitive to pragmatic criticism. Simply pointing out that other cities have a higher rate doesn't affect the criticism. Perhaps those other cities wouldn't benefit as much from lowering the vacancy rate. Perhaps those other cities would benefit a comparable amount, and we should hold them to the same criticism rather than declaring the criticism invalid.	happytoexplain	11.176551	3.8141634	comment	3.0	13.0	1578589926	-0.7003308

The description doesn't include any information about who's the renter. Usually the landlord or property manager will mention something about themselves.3. Professional photos. This in itself is not a giveaway, but given the above two clues, almost always indicates the photos were taken from another listing. A reverse image search can confirm.4.

Today, you pay very little tax on the empty land or parking lot because you’re taxed on that total value of the land and improvements. This discourages building stuff sometimes. With land value tax, you’d be taxed on what someone would pay you for that land with improvements similar to surrounding, so it’s advantageous to build something there instead of nothing, since you’re paying the same tax as the sky scraper next door.In other words, the taxable value of the land is what it would be if it had similar improvements to surrounding lands, rather than taxing it based on actual improvements.	ok_dad	11.34622	3.5990605	comment	3.0	31.0	1705600546	-0.6957768

The reason we have prop 13 is because someone 30 years ago bought a property for a couple hundred thousand dollars and by the time they pay off the mortgage, it’s worth a few million dollars but they are retirees and can’t pay the property tax.If prop 13 is repealed, older Californians should have to move out of state. Remember..no one makes money unless they SELL the property.However there is room for reform with : 1. Investment property 2. second homes 3. Foreign investments in CA properties 4. Inheritance of property and tax breaks on that..5. Prop 13 repealed for commercial properties.A retiree shouldn’t be penalized for their primary home after paying it off for 30 something years and when they are on fixed retirement incomes.	jelliclesfarm	11.230534	3.704706	comment	3.0	18.0	1552282837	-0.84854084

The unfortunate norm there is to pay a 15% fee (of the annual rent) to brokers to get a rental apartment. The cheapest the broker's fee gets is one month's rent, so about 8.33% of the annual rent. High end apartments sometimes pay the broker's fee on the renter's behalf [2]. Large apartment complexes sometimes have their own leasing offices, so there's no fee there either. To be clear, this is a one time fee paid when you initially move into the apartment. If you renew the lease, you don't owe another broker's fee.Meaning if the rent on an apartment is $2,000/month = $24,000/year, the broker's fee on that would be $24,000 * 15% = $3,600.

People should have an inherent right to place, if they didn't the immigration and native rights debates around the world would be non-existent.Rent control also has the positive effect that if renters put in effort to improve the economic value of their community and neighborhood, that they wouldn't be displaced in the process. I'd also point out that rent control doesn't always have to happen as a result of low supply, nor does rent control necessarily reduce housing construction should zoning be relaxed in the process (in the era with the highest levels of rent control in Manhattan, was also the era of the highest amount of construction).	zjaffee	11.338328	3.8431323	comment	3.0	15.0	1553699061	-0.59864706

One thing I've learned is that commercial property (be it office or residential) is always being sold. They are essentially large bonds you can touch and live in.Party A develops or buys the building, gains an annuity via rent, attempts to raise rent slowly over a few years (thus increasing the value of the property), and selling it to Party B, which repeats the process. In commercial residential buildings, this process happens faster than in an office building because leases are shorter and residential tenants can accept rent raises every 2-3 years.

(in the long term there is a smaller increase due to salaries, but the city budget isn't normally spent buying up land)So a real estate bubble hits, home owners are hurt, and the government gets used to what they think is the new normal. The government takes on wasteful obligations, hiring lots of people and failing to push back on pension demands. Once the bubble pops, the city budget is in deep trouble. Something must be cut.

People could still make worst case projections of taxes to see if they could afford things.Washington state has a different system, where the total property tax of each taxing jurisdiction can only increase by 1% each year (subject to exceptions and what not), and then that amount is apportioned to each property based on the assessed value.

Check Craigslist in affluent areas. Or just splurge.- It never hurts to ask your landlord if you can upgrade something at your own cost or by sharing the cost. Don’t just settle for white walls and junk appliances if you plan to stay a long time.- You can make smaller spaces work better by using vertical space. Mount stuff on the wall. Install closet organization. Get permission if you have to, but also a lost deposit is still cheaper than buying/selling a home. Anything you can do to make you tolerate your cheap rental enough for it to be more long term.- Don’t be a child, share bathrooms.

I love the neighbourhood, but I just don't think I'm cut out for home ownership. I've had more problems in 2 years of home ownership than I had in a decade of renting.  It's cost a ton more money.  Is it an investment?  Possibly, but I've sunk a fair bit into it as well. I now wake up on Saturday mornings with a list of things that I ""really need to get to"".  It's been terrible for my mental health, and I don't know if my bank account will ever reflect the extra mental strain."	SketchySeaBeast	11.3836355	3.6225102	comment	3.0	21.0	1561046436	-0.48298192

In SF, your cost of ownership is roughly 2% per year (1.4% property taxes, 0.5% for Earthquake Insurance, 0.3% for repairs and depreciation and HOA), which comes to a total of 2.2%.The average Rent for an equivalent house is roughly 3% of the purchase price per year.  So the spread is just 0.8%.  Which means, if you can take the equity you would have put into the house and put it somewhere else, as long as you get a 0.8% real return (easier said than done with the high PEs we're facing), then you'll be ahead with renting.  And of course, if you need to do a mortgage as most do, that adds a additional 1-3% to "	thorwasdfasdf	11.415387	3.664371	comment	3.0	17.0	1561053989	-0.47698933

Even then that hasn't been true.The problem with renting is that you're still paying the mortgage, only in the renting case you're also paying the middleman who then pays the mortgage.  This is why rent per month is higher than mortgage per month for the same house.  So the returns from that downpayment you instead invested need to make up for the monthly loss in rent, plus the lack of an asset at the end of the process.It's not a small difference either.

Housing is viewed as an investment; speculators capture the value of location and public spending by increasing the rent they charge, but don't add any value themselves, essentially siphoning value out of the community. The result is a boom/bust cycle and unaffordable rents. Disincentivizing vacancies may increase supply and lower prices, but occupied properties still have the same fundamental problem. A land tax on the unimproved value of the land is an elegant solution which incentivizes adding value to property rather than using it to park money.Edit: I'm surprised I'm being downvoted so much - maybe you disagree, but this is at least an attempt to add to the discussion.	bendmorris	11.298558	3.7299712	comment	3.0	15.0	1488740274	-0.63837826

This means that there is little competition for their business and things cost a lot.For example, rent for poor people is way too high. So why don't other people come in and offer to rent to them for less?Well, poor people have trouble paying their rent a lot of the times. They have a high chance of failing to pay, and that is costly to a landlord. So that risk is priced into the rent.What this ends up meaning, though, is that if you are poor but always pay your rent on time, you are paying for all the people who fail to pay their rent.	cortesoft	11.307604	3.7366006	comment	3.0	14.0	1490124562	-0.56599164

To put it another way, renting gives you an option to buy a house at any point in the future from a strictly better financial position than you'd be in than if you bought a house now. Owning a house is expensive, and the cost basis of the landlord is almost always much lower than your cost basis, so they can make a profit renting it for less than your cost if you bought it.This is particularly true in the current market. For example, if you bought the place I own today with a 20% down payment, the monthly payments after subtracting payments against principal would significantly exceed the rent on the same place.

And now there is a proposal to remove all R-1 (residential) zoning, so large appts can be build anywhere, all in the name of making housing more affordable.But past increases in supply have not made housing affordable, and the effect will be to convert older smaller (cheaper) single family homes into apartment complexes that are designed for students, not single families.

But people who think the Zestimate is an over estimate will of course sell to Zillow. So instead of a normal distribution of actual value:estimated value you end up with a skew towards the end where the estimate is over the actual value.Trading housing is very different from normal market making because houses are not fungible commodities like most securities are.

I understand people do it when they only plan on living in a place for a brief period of time, but you'd still be better off buying a house, then selling after a few years in most time spans. There is risk though, but I doubt the risk would ever equal $3000 a month loss you are currently taking.For example, if you bought a house, it would have to lose $72K value in 2 years or $144K in 4 years (minus inflation, taxes, maintenance) to break even with paying $3000/month rent.However, if your house appreciates as most do in highly industrialized areas, you basically get paid to live there.

Now, even though this duty is also usually derided as fictional, the argument, if this duty did exist, would be reasonable.

The main argument that I see against land value taxes is that land doesn't generate any income by itself, which forces people to pay money in situation where they might not have any income to do so.One could bypass this problem by putting in limitations, like an requirement to be high-income before the tax is applicable. One could also limit land tax to specific zones outside of low density residential areas so it doesn't go into effect when the land owner and the person living there is the same person.	belorn	11.357705	3.6257017	comment	3.0	38.0	1650099884	-0.6628678

I can't imagine paying USD 4,999 every month in rent for this house at the moment. What gives? Is rent too low? M	pooper	11.362283	3.720986	comment	3.0	10.0	1651138483	-0.47894093

It's difficult to stress this enough, but T-54's and T-62's do not have a long life span under these conditions.So the DPRK would need to achieve total surprise, fight ~20 miles to Seoul against an opponent who is equipped with mostly modern weapons, and who has planned for this very attack.

Housing is the largest expense of most people I know, and there's a ton of price weirdness. A kitchen remodeling might cost $14k, and that's not something you can buy on Amazon, and it's not like you can get your kitchen remodel done in China for cheaper (well, unless your house is in China.)

But almost all of them did come with nothing, only small portions of the ultra rich were able to sneak out any signicant amount of wealth. The Castro regime did not allow you to take your worldly possessions with you. Bank accounts were frozen, homes were inventoried, and bags were searched. But they all felt lucky enough to escape with their lives and freedoms. And they did bring the values and virtues that served them well in their previous lives.I also reject your premise that all of these people were profiting directly from the Batista dictatorship. There was corruption in Cuba, but there was also capitalism.	wildmusings	12.125129	4.485909	comment	3.0	13.0	1497271363	-14.423528

That's simply something that needs to be banned. After you've moved in, landlords should only be allowed to increase rent by either inflation, or the average increase in new rent in the area.

It's all a constant juggling of incentives, unforeseen consequences and catching up. UBIs and minimum wage are not designed to solve house affordability, so I'm not even sure why you'd lump it into capping rents, etc.Without interventions you leave all the power to the profiteers, to the ones seeking to rent-seek as most as possible, so I'm very sure your approach of ""less intervention"" would just bring another set of unforeseen consequences with a worse side: complete lack of accountability.

Think about how rents have changed over the past few years versus home sale prices, particularly with interest rates being a roller coaster these past few years.

If you don't, then the owner is losing money - and that's not likely.Now with a larger business owning your home/apartment/etc, i imagine there is room for economies of scale. They don't have to pay to have a plumber come out, they might already have one on staff or retainer. etc. Perhaps they get better deals on"	unshavedyak	11.369122	3.7633936	comment	4.0	30.0	1671596028	-0.5365415

26543835	I wonder how much of this is related	I wonder how much of this is related to the eviction moratorium. Anecdotally, my wife has a house that had a tenant in it. She was planning on selling it last year, but she had a hard time getting the tenant out. His lease had expired, and he also hadn't paid rent. He thought that the moratorium should cover him even though his lease had expired for several months. She only recently got him to move out, and she put the house up for sale right away. I bet there are more sellers than her in this situation.I suspect that once the moratorium is up, there will be a lot of landlords looking to sell. They've been not getting rent for a long time, and they may have to sell in order to get out of the hole they're in. Many still have mortgages, but they will have a hard time collecting a year worth 	kevin42	11.433972	3.8322947	comment	4.0	130.0	1616434154	-0.67943126

This is already true, but it would be especially so if the county handed you a $100k tax bill when you sold.I don't think we want to see homeowners unable to sell because the tax burden is too high.	dpark	11.354287	3.615456	comment	4.0	24.0	1474858869	-0.69874924

For buyers they can let you into a house.Being able to do these things requires NAR membership, a state license, and other fees and cost real estate agents thousands per year. Also driving meetings clients at houses takes gas and time. Also your 6% commisiion is paying for all the other people that the agent spent gas and time on who did not buy a house.Would you be willing to advertise in the news paper that your house is for sale and leave the doors unlocked so that random people could check it out?	wehadfun	11.670919	3.6235301	comment	4.0	24.0	1481320166	-11.3688

Rents within 60km/35mi of the main Sydney CBD have crossed well over 50% of the average persons wage, at around $700/week. I currently live 45km from Sydney and pay $800/wk for a detached house primarily because I don't want to live in a 1 bedroom box in the city. Unfortunately, for that $800, I get next to no public transport and a local government that doesn't actually do anything useful. If I had the option I would gladly have stayed at home for a few years to start saving for a deposit on a house, which is no easy feat since the national average price is creeping closer to the $1m mark, and the average around major cities is already we	PebblesHD	11.157583	3.6102283	comment	4.0	35.0	1482385063	-0.70006895

There's some good ideas here that would at least facilitate efficiently viewing more apartments. But there's still so much extremely basic information that potential renters either cannot get about a unit or have to jump through hoops to get. Noise issues, pest issues, construction and renovation details, information about how the management company operates, light levels, info about neighbors and on and on. Ninety percent of the important information about a rental unit isn't discovered until the weeks and months after a lease has been signed, and I am desperate for someone to fix this problem."	standardUser	11.3757925	3.8003478	comment	4.0	15.0	1625764751	-0.6979001

At least a percentage of every dollar will come back to you with a mortgage. Not to mention if you buy a home, you'll often pay less than you would renting. This makes perfect sense if you think about it, the landlord is trying to make money.Point being, buying a home is a ""nest egg"" which is why 0-5% down was and is a thing.If you don't like landlords move, and buy your own home.

Consider that the median home in Palo Alto sold for less than $20,000 in 1956, versus $2.5 million today — an appreciation rate of 12,500%. Compare that to an approximate 5000% return for the S&P 500 over the same period (much higher with dividend reinvestment, but you’d need to pay taxes on said dividends, making this calculation challenging).Normally when you're comparing asset classes you don't compare the average of one class to the absolute best possible case in the other.

If, in a city of 100,000 people, only the richest 100 can afford (less than 1% of the population) a house but there's only 10 houses on the market, then prices can still continue to skyrocket.Overall demand does not need to be super high for prices to go up.

There’s still fewer units than there are people who want them, so people would get units based on some other mechanism beside price such as a lottery.The unpredictability this would entail would probably be worse than a functioning price mechanism. Imagine you get a job in San Francisco but there’s only a 20% chance you’ll be able to “win” a housing unit where you want.

It's also easy to imagine an alternate universe where most homes are owned by institutional landlords, people rent, and invest what their interest payments would have gone to in index funds instead, winding up with a more reliable chunk of cash when they retire instead of a home whose value is hard to predict.	crazygringo	11.436614	3.607122	comment	4.0	21.0	1546660415	-0.43858215

The local MLS in any given area has the ability to cut off access to anyone. Some are even privately owned. In order to disrupt an area, you have to get a slice of listing larger than what’s available in the local MLS and then get more people’s eyeballs on those listings than the combined circulation that the existing MLS feeds were getting...and then still have some means of showing the houses in person.And you have to do that for EVERY single market you enter.A 	brightball	11.669682	3.6352549	comment	4.0	33.0	1547672576	-11.393432

This gives them a better chance to get the property before the MLS hordes descend and start bidding it up.The part I've never understood is, as a seller, why wouldn't I want my property to have the largest exposure and the most interested buyers.

Think about it: if the local market moves, it largely doesn't affect you. You can argue if you're underwater, it's bad. It's not good but your actual liability tends to be limited, particularly in no recourse states.

Smaller landlords who used to just rent out their vacation homes are getting out of the market.If you own two homes, and you rent one out as a source of income, but all of a sudden that tenant doesn't want to pay, you have a problem. If you own a portfolio of 100 homes, and half the tenants don't want to pay odds are you can just sit on your appreciating assets until you sell it anyway.What's even scarier is many of these units are going to remain un occupied forever. If you buy a house, and it goes up in value $50,000 per year, it might be easier to leave it vacant. The only solution is much easier zoning, and laxer building requirements.For example, in LA apartments are mandated to have a parking space per unit.

On the other hand, most go into it with the hope of just sitting on stuff and making passive income for low amounts of work.

The solutions there typically tax only the difference in land value versus a baseline assessment. So if a lot is worth $100 before LVT and $105 after, the tax is calculated only on the $5 difference.Valuing the land is tricky because the whole point of LVT is to tax only the location itself.

Buying a house is basically a part-time job for the buyer now and being able to respond instantly is so important.The job has changed, just like all jobs have, but good agents get shit done because the market is so competitive.

If it's going to cost me $1,000/sq ft, I'm barely going to be able to afford the space I want to live in. If a group of us can rent at cheap prices we're saving money on our housing and paying for a shared second space doesn't cost that much.Over the past 15 years or so, property prices have soared in so many cities.

And wages aren't rising, and rental companies buying up properties every chance they get.Something needs to change. Why screw oneself with a 30 year mortgage, plus property taxes, plus constant maintenance headaches? And deal with shitty HOA too, in some places. Maybe this is a good way to silently protest and force progressive housing policy changes.	akudha	11.19449	3.8024516	comment	4.0	26.0	1614501762	-0.64557105

That argument doesn’t address the fact that many cities have an absolute limit on supply in the form of space, and no amount of construction that starts today will bring prices down today.Here are some arguments to refute if you want to oppose rent control, particularly the first one (copied and pasted directly from investopedia):“Rental prices in many U.S. cities are rising far faster than wages for moderate-income jobs. [edit: note here that most of the US has banned rent control, and this is happening regardless]“Rent control enables moderate-income families and elderly people on fixed incomes to live decently and without fear of a personally catastrophic rent hike.“Neighborhoods are safer and more stable with a base of long-term residents in rent-controlled apartments.”	dahart	11.296367	3.828529	comment	4.0	18.0	1614698829	-0.56486386

For some people, it absolutely means not being kicked out into the streets. Go tell that mom and her kids about 'the market'. Yet at the same time, markets, supply and demand are real, and we need to bring them back into balance by at the very least not artificially constraining housing supply in so many places.It's a tricky problem.	davidw	11.268872	3.7617505	comment	4.0	16.0	1614713944	-0.5824613

It just shuffles around who lives in existing houses.If you have a housing problem, and you want to solve it, you need to do two things.1. Not kick people out of housing that they have. (Because it is incredibly disruptive to people's lives.)2. Build new housing, until demand is met.Rent control accomplishes #1, proper city planning accomplishes #2. If you're not doing #2, complaining about #1 isn't going to solve the problem.If you are doing #2, then #1 isn't a problem.	vkou	11.235458	3.8111055	comment	4.0	34.0	1614716967	-0.63878787

When you are a landlord and the home doesn't rent, my first instinct would be to lower the price until people start showing up, yet this doesn't appear to be happening. Even the opposite, landlords would rather kick someone out that can't afford a hike in rent prices than to keep prices at the same level. To me it seems better to have a lower income occupied property than a high income but non-occupied property (effectively making the income 0, and with upkeep cost making it a net expense). Maybe there's some kind of mechanism I don't see because I'm not a landlord myself. How do landlords get the money to bridge the periods their properties are vacant?

One of the most interesting things to me is that on the bay, you can have two houses next to each other, both for sale and both equivalent in terms of house quality. One house happens to be on colony land and the other is not, so when you buy one house you own the land, but the other you get the 99 year lease. What I find interesting is that there is little to no difference in price between the two. The market prices the 99 year lease the same as owning the land.

Usually it is a combination of relay loans (not free) and conditional contracts (tricky and pretty much the same result).If you are a first time buyer it does not matter much apart from adding delays.I don't see how reforming (how?) a system that is simple and cheap would help solve the ""housing crisis"".

Already having nuked Japan in WW2, Truman did not want to issue that threat. It wasn't until his successor, Eisenhower, came to power that the US threatened the use of the atomic bomb, and the N.

Depending on luck, you may live for 40 years or more past retirement. Must one move away from family that serves as a support system?Some states do reassess, but recognize that that is a policy choice.

A big money maker has been concessions for not pursuing nukes [1]. The money must almost be dried up from the last one, thus the posturing.In the end this stems from a lack of coherent plans after invading Korea back in the day.  We are lucky Vietnam didn't end up the way Korea did or we'd have the same situation still today.  The middle east may also turn into something like this.The US has to learn to win wars by economically winning over people and giving them more opportunity and freedoms, like Marshall plans back after WWII, ones in which we were also paid for but benefitted all.We are greatly failing at rebuilding after invasions and this is another example of how that has blowback.[1] https:	drawkbox	12.038603	4.0248313	comment	4.0	38.0	1504427009	5.5236874

Local governments would no longer get higher payouts for zoning for high end housing, they would only get higher payouts if they raised the net desirability of all land within the borders of their city as a whole.The land value tax would also f	theseus7	11.277175	3.715765	comment	4.0	20.0	1509309043	-0.65714264

aware of that took the issue head-on, from the Cato institute.They found that rent control greatly benefits recipients, that rents increase diffusely citywide (about 5%), and that the overall positive and negative impacts were roughly equally balanced (~$3Bn over 17 years). The net is slightly positive, in fact.In other words, rent control pretty much does what’s printed on the tin: helps certain renters a lot, hurts others a tiny amount, averages out to zero net impact. Here’s the TL;DR:”On net, incumbent San Francisco residents appear to come out ahead, but this is at the great expense of welfare losses from future inhabitants.”You can certainly debate "	irq11	11.185227	3.8339357	comment	4.0	23.0	1568949776	-0.6469011

Absent Prop 13, people would literally be forced from their homes from high taxes.Prop 13 was a response to the inflation of the 1970s that drove asset and investment prices higher.	jnordwick	11.271305	3.7163537	comment	4.0	15.0	1580437792	-0.7318099
22201994	Prop 13 and rent control both highly	Prop 13 and rent control both highly encourage NIMBYism and I would say are more important factors than property values. If a large apartment is built next to your house and you don't like the extra noise, the big shadow, and lots of people looking into your back yard, you could decide to move. Without prop 13 selling your house and moving a few blocks over to a location you like better is a pain in the ass and you have to pay off the realtors, but once you move, you just get on with your life. With prop 13 your property tax could double or triple, say going from $1000 a month to $3000 a month. This $2000 a month, every month, is going to make you mad and hurt you financially constantly for the rest of your life. No wonder people fight so hard to keep things like it was when they moved in.	njarboe	11.252035	3.7204466	comment	4.0	22.0	1580481705	-0.8664874

Needlessly high rents are an economics problem, and there's a lot of evidence that a combination of expanding housing supply and imposing a Land Value Tax would be an actual economic solution.

When we have problems with reservations we made through booking.com, and post Covid a lot of hotels seem to overbook so we’ve rolled in and found we have no place to stay on several occasions, it’s just single phone call to booking.com resolve the issue.

On the other hand, typically the cultures are non-confrontational so as a person from the US I just get loud and be like what the fuck are you doing. They realize their mistake and sheepishly moved to the back.Very much a different cultural concept because most of the time no one else will say anything they just deal with it.  I think in the US if you cut in line you might get shot or at minimum start some sort of physical altercation. And people just generally know this so they don't do it.	elmerfud	11.987131	3.6510239	comment	4.0	12.0	1685675229	9.415755

There’s a lot less work involved than running an operating business, and if the property cash flows (rent exceeds costs), you have a little bit of cash every month. There are also tax advantages via mortgage interest and other expense deductibility, and some “forced savings” as the mortgage pays down. The flip side is that real estate has been absurdly overpriced in most markets for the last decade (thanks Fed!) but the still-unfolding economic consequences of Covid19 may lead to an excellent entry point.	voisin	11.482889	3.73526	comment	4.0	15.0	1596569968	-0.33873308

20485827	Here’s an anti rent control argument	Here’s an anti rent control argument I haven’t heard (this applies to stricter rent control regimes like NYC, SF - not sure about this new OR law). Getting a spot in a rent-controlled apartment is a valuable, non-transferable asset. If you buy a house and it gains $100,000 in equity, you can sell it and buy a bigger house, sell it and cash out while getting a smaller house, borrow against it. With a rent-control asset, you can’t do any of those things, so you have fewer options, but if you move, you just forfeit the asset. That’s a big economic drag.I wonder how many rent-controlled residents in SF/NYC would accept a $100k buyout that would convert the apt to market rate. Has anyone seen a study of the spreads between market/rent-controlled, by city/zip/census tract? I’d love to see that.	pchristensen	11.247567	3.8402317	comment	4.0	19.0	1563631635	-0.6069161

It is literally econ 101, probably literally first week of econ 101.There may be wrinkles or complexities.  Obviously, in an infill situation, if you tear down existing housing and then build new housing, it's less clear that overall affordability will increase.  There may be a backlog of demand that means that as new stock comes onto the market, the affordability increases less than you would imagine.But is it basically true?  Sure.  Even if you build new units only for millionaires, that takes the millionaires out of competition for other high end markets, which then makes people who were previously marginal for those units get them, and takes them out of competition for the next tier down, etc.	aetherson	11.22855	3.754974	comment	4.0	33.0	1488574156	-0.61952835

If you're sitting on hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, you can't just stick it all in a savings account or an index fund. It has to go somewhere. Real estate is one place.Consider a $20 million Manhattan apartment. Even if it has a ""management fee"" of $5k per month (not uncommon), that's still only 0.3% per year. Far less than you'd pay to a hedge fund or other investment manager to hold on to the money.Ultimately I think it will be self-defeating.

14302233	The problem with renting is, that it	The problem with renting is, that it will return to you a temporal value(a space to live in each month, after the month this value is basically gone), whereby buying a house will return a lasting value, which you can even use by selling the house. In order to tackle this, the law should be implementing mechanisms to return value to the renter, like the ability to buy the flat after living in it for a certain number of years(like 15-20 years) for a multipel of the monthly rent. This would encourage people to rent longer and would return a fraction of their paid rent to them. But the details would be very complicated, like how do you prevent the landlords using the contract to kick people out, when they've rented the flat almost long enough to buy it?As rents were cheaper in the previous dec	zaph0d_	11.361883	3.7479763	comment	4.0	14.0	1494351814	-0.53616387

Those places have to meet all sorts of standards which cost money, even if we can all agree they are necessary (ex: running water, bedrooms need window access for fire escape, etc).The costs of real estate raise the costs for everybody. The renter. The company on floor 6. The bagel shop around the corner. When their real estate costs go up, the rent goes up, the prices of bagels go up, and so on.There is no magic wand to fix this problem. Like climate change, it is an enormous problem that requires action on as many fronts as possible.As far as we can tell, population will keep rising, and the value of land will keep going up.

This is an important distinction. Neither party is paying them for an accurate estimate ergo they are not obligated to provide an estimate sufficient for either buyer or seller, which is why both sides are best advised to PAY for an accurate estimate before closing a transactions worth hundreds of thousands.I'm honestly not seeing the problem here.  Don't such people already hire experts to asses value before spending half a million dollars?  I'm seeing the claim that inaccurate estimates lead to difficulties selling but I have yet to see the proof.

A corporation can't live in a house, so they'd be renting it out. If these evvvill corporations were keeping houses vacant just to screw over regular hard working folks, resulting in no effect on the rental market prices, then we'd see it in the vacancy stats. But that's never actually mentioned by housing conspiracy theorists because the vacancy stats show that the areas with highest prices have extremely low vacancy rates, because demand for housing is so much higher than supply, because not enough housing has been built.	woah	11.330803	3.7313967	comment	4.0	20.0	1649349799	-10.789423

In those 30 years you probably painted it a few times, changed the roof just recently, changed the kitchen, and so forth. Plus 30 years of property tax. So you're probably in for $200k on that $130k house. And that's not even counting interest on mortgages that most buyers had in 1993.Doubling your money in 30 years isn't great at all.

Reduce the loss and more supply appears.In the US this is a huge issue. If you switch cities twice and sell each time, your entire downpayment has disappeared in fees/taxes. You literally have nothing left to buy your next home with. So people stick around in houses they dont want in cities without ideal jobs because they have no choice.

They do not properly incentive the efficient use of land, so mini-kings get to sit in their mini-castles and argue against densification while looking down on the new-comer peasants.And the current situation is already “destroying” peoples lives as their courses into “normal” adulthood are interrupted and delayed, so it’s somewhat a question of who feels the effects. The difference with devaluing homes is that people may lose some wealth, but they still have a home! Investments are supposed to risky, that’s why you make money off of them sometimes; so let’s make it that way for houses.	merrywhether	11.308821	3.6648688	comment	4.0	16.0	1649430332	-0.63787895

If you apply a bit more critical thinking you can start to question whether the fact that a small proportion of people have a monopoly on the ownership, allocation, and creation of capital, and are therefore able to extract rent from loaning it out without providing any value themselves, whether that is a good thing at all.	andrepd	11.343366	3.7833464	comment	4.0	16.0	1634760025	-0.6204154

I still think its a dictatorial regime that needs to be abolished and the North Korean people deserve democracy, but the day to day life of an average North Korean residing in a large city is not very different than any of us here.	typon	12.027997	4.023415	comment	4.0	18.0	1637684233	5.5166326

It’s simple: impose a heavy tax on unoccupied vacation homes but offer an exemption for owners who house one local worker on the property year-round.  The concept is that the owner of a big vacation home would build a small apartment, perhaps in a basement or in the rear of the home, or even detached, that could house 1-2 locals, and would rent it out for an affordable price.  In exchange, the owner gets a break from the hefty tax and they have an on-site theft deterrent.Back in my ski town days, I had several friends who lived in peoples’ vacation homes as on-site 	chrissnell	11.211117	3.7919164	comment	4.0	14.0	1638160969	-0.612349

34576758	To see it from the other side, I’d s	To see it from the other side, I’d suggest trying to reframe your mindset about rent.As an example, let’s take a homeowner who rents their old house to someone when they purchase a second home. The question is, what value are they providing to the renter to justify the huge cost? The rent payment must cover the mortgage payment and maintenance or else the landlord would be loosing money. The landlord essentially ends up with a free house, while the renter ends up loosing many tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, and at the end of the lease, they have nothing.The only value the landlord provided was happening to own an asset that’s in huge demand. If that asset was abundant, the renter would very likely be able to buy their own and be much better off.Rent-seeking behavior (which is dra	noahtallen	11.331868	3.769544	comment	4.0	14.0	1675062935	-0.56108344

People still buy groceries despite sales taxes (which, again, we want people to buy stuff).Thus, the argument that a vacancy tax compels rental property owners to rent their places falls.

We managed to find a place outside of the city, but close enough to transit for a manageable commute. And rent was about the same, though for an apartment half the size.And then, as housing prices continued to rise, that apartment raised the rent 25%. Fortunately, they gave us 60 days notice, so we started looking around for an affordable home to purchase (even farther away, but still near transit), and found one where the PITI+HOA was less than the new rent would have been.Rents have continued to ris	Johnny555	11.265458	3.7580194	comment	5.0	21.0	1524456152	-0.5273027

I see the possibility of a landlord bringing more units online but still charging $3-4k a month rent just because they can.

The higher your income, the less rent control you get, up to the point (say, $100k+) where you aren't protected by it at all.

First step is the generation of interest bearing loans, secured against the non paying owner's equity. (Effectively auto sale of part of the non-paying owner's portion of the house.)

The editors at China Investment Network determined that if a city's ratio of people to area was 0.5 – that is, it was half full – then it is a ghost town. To take the example a step further, if a city had a ratio of .10, then it had one-tenth the population the government thought it deserved.

If you depreciate the property to avoid or reduce your taxable income you'll end up taking a big hit on the eventual sale as it will all be capital gains.Another issue I'd take with this is that it's a lot smarter to focus on cashflow then gross income because odds are you aren't going to last 30 years to watch your net worth grow if you are losing cash on a monthly basis, even if you are technically building equity.I'm currently getting out of being a landlord because while it was overall profitable, the margins are alot tighter after factoring in taxes and it's also a massive headache.

But I use 1/100th the amount of land they use. Meanwhile, the cost to the city in terms of infrastructure (pipes, roads, drainage, etc) is much lower than the houses in the subdivision down the road.In effect, today's laws makes high-density-home owners subsidize the high cost of maintaining subdivisions by taxing on total value only. Switch it to 50% value and 50% land use, with explicit line items for each and you'll see more demand for high density housing.	mabbo	11.347587	3.6185167	comment	5.0	20.0	1556461672	-0.65134954

There will be a judgement against RealPage, the US being the only country in the world where commercial law is decided with trial by jury virtually guarantees it.Then rents will start rising even more. Landlords will be willing to do price discovery the old fashioned way, offering it with a high rent and letting the unit stay vacant until someone pays it.The cat's out of the bag. Now that people understand how much the market will bear with the present shortage of homes, rents are never going to go down.If RealPage has caused a rise in prices, it's because it showed old assumptions are wrong. Nothing short of mass brainwashing could bring them back.

37911876	Land value tax is an idea by Henry G	"Land value tax is an idea by Henry George - the guy who coined the phrase ""the rent is too damn high"". His idea is among other things that a property tax discourages investment - one way to make money as an investor is to hold a plot of empty land in a desirable city centre location, watch it go up in value, and neither pay tax on any development on it nor bother with messy things such as tenants. Taxing the land value, according to George, removes that perverse incentive.For a more detailed overview, I recommend Lars Doucet's review of George's Progress and Poverty, which won the Astral Codex Ten book review contest a year ago: https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/your-book-review-progress-a...I really like the style, but you need to put an hour or so aside to read the whole thing.

Doing so would nullify the investment arms race that’s turning home ownership into a sick financial game.If you’re paying 6%/year in property taxes, a home is no longer an “investment”, and the house hoarding (especially by the likes of investors buying single-family housing) will cease. People will buy homes to have a place to live, and the market will cool off.This comes with the additional benefit of progressively taxing wealth instead of solely income. Wealth discrepancy is orders of magnitude worse than income discrepancy, and currently we’re doing almost nothing about that.	purplerabbit	11.337699	3.6148164	comment	5.0	22.0	1699388833	-0.57931197

I'm not sure what the numbers are now, but when I bought and later sold my house, I determined that 6-7 years was the minimum duration that made home ownership better than just renting.People change jobs more frequently now than in the past, and consequently they tend to move around more often.  That makes investing in a home more risky, as it's really unclear if one will still want to be in that home/location in 5 years.  Renting, by comparison, is less risky.

If you ever have the misfortune of dealing with them, they will absolutely impact your financial and mental well-being. My grandpa died and we had to deal with meth head squatters who moved into his place (in California) and it was easily one of the worst abuses of the legal system I've ever dealt with. You can basically just break into a property and put a toothbrush down and tell the cops you had a verbal agreement with the previous owner and there's not much the police/sheriffs can do without a court order which takes months and a lawyer ($$$$$). Meanwhile, the meth heads are destroying the property.

Period. Its primary purpose is to allow families to own and live in the house. Mandating that can eliminate the rich landlords/foreign investors buying houses just for investment, stabilize the demand and drive down the prices.One way to mandate that could be progressive property tax based on how many properties you already own with a max cap on number of allowed residential properties one can own. This might decrease incentive to build new housing for developers, but can be solved by temporary tax breaks for building new housing.Am I missing some second order effects?	aaggarwal	11.283752	3.7367194	comment	5.0	18.0	1629997334	-0.64162284

US companies owned 60% of the sugar production. But during the great depression, the US introduced tariffs on a wide range of goods (from everywhere), and the Cuban sugar industry collapsed.Then when Fidel came to power one of the things he promised was to reduce the reliance on US trade.

I'm not understanding how housing that is in use can be considered supply available for others. Say we make it easier to evict and change nothing else: one family is evicted so another can take the unit. I don't see how that improves anything if the goal is to get both families housed. All it seems to do is enable landlords to play arbitrage and charge the highest possible price.	omegaworks	11.278893	3.8457491	comment	5.0	52.0	1627580302	-0.69023544

I've had luck with both pay-to-play aggregators like http://www.rdny.com, as well as blind Google searching. Friends of mine have also done free aggregators like streetyeasy, and one even just showed up to a building and asked about free listings.This is useful if you want to rent an apartment, not a specific apartment.

The price of both our house and the one we'd want to move to have both doubled since we bought ten years ago.  If we moved today we would have to pay capital gains tax and our annual property tax would nearly double.  If housing prices collapsed and went back to where they were when we bought we could make the move essentially for free.That's the insidious thing about rising housing prices.

When someone says that what they really mean is ""I don't like the look of that"", but they can't just say that, it has to have a vague monetary penalty for them to be taken seriously.Whenever someone hits you with that make sure you get them to document the reduction in their property value in dollars, including methodology.  It's not possible, houses sell for whatever someone buys it for and you can't know the mind of buyers.  Maybe the fact that your door is off-tan instead of off-medium-tan will make some buyer reduce their offer on a house 5 doors down by $20,000, but there's no way to prove that."	jandrese	11.48836	3.6787112	comment	5.0	25.0	1671645546	-0.5632783

Unfortunately the new owner of the ground started charging me for ridiculous fees, each one hundreds of pounds for nonsense things.  (This is entirely legal).

Rising sale prices coupled with big losses implies Zillow has been systematically paying above-market rates for homes, and there's a lot of evidence corroborating that hypothesis [2].

I think that what's happening in real estate is perfectly normal from an economics point of view.  Mortgage rates are extremely low, more people are moving because of remote work opportunities, and the younger folks wanting to buy homes now outnumber the baby boomers, all of which has created high demand for houses.  Zoning regulations seem to have limited the construction of denser, multi-family home options like townhomes, duplexes, etc.  And construction of new homes was likely affected by supply problems with labor and materials during the height of the pandemic.	jschveibinz	11.299953	3.6895254	comment	5.0	16.0	1636845603	-0.7048727

If it sells at $500k he gets $30k, if it sells at $520k he gets $31k. If he were to get a $500k offer it probably isn't worth his time to put in a lot of extra effort to try to get that extra $1k, but to you that extra $19k is a lot of money. You might want to do another open house but the agent will convince you to just take the offer in hand. I think this is one of the reasons that agents use all these short deadlines and pressure tactics, it's not just to get the buyers locked in, they want to be in and out of each deal as quickly as possible so they can move on to the next deal.Not sure how to fix that,	guelo	11.677972	3.6100545	comment	5.0	17.0	1490121378	-11.387369

There is no upside to this. We got cheap Chinese plastic trinkets. They got our real estate. Didn't we do this to the indigenous people here once ourselves?To be clear: I'm not opposed to being able to buy foreign land per se, but I am opposed to how one-sided this is.

I live in a suburb close to a tech hub in WA. They built a lot of housing in the past 3 years. And I mean a lot. At least a couple of hundred of apartments on the market every year, after raising 3-4 buildings at the same time, in a town of 20k people.One would think that the price would go down based on supply and demand, right? More than half of the apartments were empty while the management companies were not budging on the price. Nobody wanted to go below 2k/month for a one bedroom and they were sitting around with empty apartments. Finally they managed to reel in some suckers by offering 2-3 months free rent but again, no rent was going below 	decebalus1	11.309741	3.7901611	comment	5.0	20.0	1568249139	-0.598287

The landlord doesn't shovel snow or mow grass, I do.They do carry some of the burden specifically in taxes and liability, yes I know. I also know the maintenance responsibilities aren't inherently and legally mine, and so I can be blamed for entering a contract that requires me to do this.Anyway though it even more shows that landlords don't inherently do anything. If they stopped maintaining it, the tenant is the one who has to live in the shitty house and will wind up fixing it.What the landlord does is control access to housing. I don't respect or value that and you're not going to change my mind about it today.	giraffe_lady	11.411103	3.7855191	comment	5.0	18.0	1647641881	-0.6024641

Land (in an area with a growing population) is a finite resource, like gold or precious metals.

However you have to really know what rates (read the economy) will do so that just as they reach the bottom (you don't need to hit the exact bottom, just get close) to refinance to fixed rate.They are also good if you have reason to believe you won't live there for more than a couple years. (in general renting is better than buying if your time frame is less than 7-10 years, but local factors may force you to buy anyway).Since ARMs are lower rates they save you money in the short run.

Buyer sentiment matters. Prices were cheap 3 years ago, but I couldn’t convince friends to buy, even offering to help my friends with the deposit. Then Suddenly everybody wanted to buy a house and prices went up 30%+.2. Demand outstrips supply by at least 3X. It is virtually impossible to increase supply enough: people invest, people buy second homes, wealthy people with empty houses because they don’t get enough rent to make it worth letting, everyone wants their own home instead of sharing, children and marriage breakups want their own homes.3.

Since when is the default economic behavior for humans a benevolent and unselfish one? You don’t see people just hanging out the extra cash in their bank account, so why should they do the same thing with an extra property? If you’re looking for someone to aim at, it should be various levels of government and the corporate entities which make this behavior possible, and with relatively little friction.The humans are just doing what is incentivized and what they see other humans doing.FWIW interest rates on mortgages for investment properties/vacation properties are typically a good deal higher than primary residences, and this is one to reduce demand for such things.	mym1990	11.327982	3.8366723	comment	5.0	44.0	1677379082	-0.56085217

Anyone owning an empty house or apartment should be taxed whatever amount it necessary to encourage them into at least renting that place out and thereby expanding the pool of available living units in the market.	sandworm101	11.315589	3.7303076	comment	5.0	19.0	1703171798	-0.6342195

Both will contribute to worsening the issue.Plus even at low levels NIMBYism is often about investment.  Sure, many object to new housing for reasons like ""it will change the character of the neighborhood"".  But many others object because they are worried about the value of their own home going down.

There's two harsh truth for me:* It would be crazy not to rent a rent-controlled place in a market like SF. This is what everybody tries to do here, and honestly I would probably not have moved here if I couldn't have found a place without rent-control. It is just too risky (your rent can pretty much double in a week, forcing you to move out).* SF's real housing problem is that there's a lack of housing. This has nothing to do with rent control, and focusing the story on rent control is like ignoring the bigger elephant in the room. It's a malicious distraction tactic. Check the numbers, the population of SF has remained extremely stabled since the 90s[1], the reason is that there's no more space for people to live.Ask yourself this questio	baby	11.172631	3.8626902	comment	5.0	21.0	1569259603	-0.6058247

Housing in the US is valued solely by the value of the housing around it (called 'comps' or 'comparables'). Building new luxury housing raises the price for all preexisting nearby housing, because your comparables will now be based on whatever the luxury housing prices are (even if your own house is very modest, even if your own house could never fetch a similar price, even if you never try to sell your house)This is one of the big reasons you see pushback by rational, logical, well-informed residents in the US.

Therefore it actually might make sense to just have the property sit vacant with a (now) ridiculous rental price.If governments start implementing a vacancy tax that grows as vacancy duration increases, essentially forcing the market to unstick, we'd likely see a rapid implosion of commercial real estate.

Selling pressure means prices go down in the near term.Instead what's been happening for at least a year is that the landlords have been putting rents up. This works for as long as renters are willing to pay up. There's less and less reason to, though.

There is a lot of validity here: there are cases where rich property owners are not paying their fair share in taxes. But it’s often a disingenuous argument meant just to deflect responsibility.The property tax rules were originally passed to protect senior citizens from losing their homes because they couldn’t afford to pay surging tax rates. A boom happens, their house values go up, but they’re still living in fixed incomes.I literally just read a Twitter exec, on Twitter, openly say that well seniors could just sell their homes. Nice!

Yes, you can potentially leverage your equity into acquiring more homes. But real estate gains have traditionally lagged the stock market. So as you continue this cycle, you increase your leverage dramatically while investing in highly-correlated and slightly underperforming assets.Meanwhile, little of these gains are able to be used for actual lifestyle improvements until you start unloading these properties.	stouset	11.376089	3.6616266	comment	5.0	25.0	1694284225	-0.48099774

With the recent passing of Prop 19, things get even worse: people who are looking to inherit homes from their parents are in for a shock if they have siblings --- they may be forced to pay a much higher property tax if they do not all live in the property! Prop 19 is written to benefit Realtors and Firefighters: realtors get to pry houses out of seniors' hands to sell, and firefighters get to increase their salaries and ranks.

There is no reason to double (or more) the rent on a space. They are doing it because maybe someone will pay, and until then, they get to claim the loss of income as a write off on their taxes. If this is not true, then how can property owners, who claim that they need the new rental rate, afford to leave a place empty for a year or more???	lr	11.358142	3.7705617	comment	5.0	29.0	1578581446	-0.61639005

Clearly demand from investors would raise sale prices, but why would renters pay more to rent in buildings owned by shady oligarchs? Seems like it would just push up the price-rent ratio, which we definitely can see in the data. If anything, that indicates renters are getting a better deal, paying a smaller portion of the capital cost of living in a scarce asset.Ie. if big city real estate is a particularly good place for oligarchs to park cash illegally, they ought to be getting less real returns then they could get on normal investments like the stock market. If they are overpaying for these properties, they are transferring wealth (on net) to the domestic sellers and/or  tenants.	sjjshzvuiajhz	11.36607	3.770871	comment	6.0	84.0	1548661699	-0.49964064

Speaking from experience of a friend who was a plumber for one of these condo complexes:In a condo, if an HOA is required to fix plumbing or landscaping, paint, or roofing, then it comes out of the CAM fees paid by the residents.  However, if the HOA does NOT pay for that work, or tries to stiff the construction firm they hire, the construction company can take out a lien on the property until their bill is paid.That lien means you cannot sell your condo until the HOA pays their debt.   In my friends case, the HOA had blown all their CAM money on lavish vacations and dinners for key members of the HOA board.  They had no money to pay for a sewage repair job, and left 54 members of the housing compex stuck with a $20,000USD repair bill.

A lot of Realtors won't even deal with non-Realtor(tm) real-estate agents, which promotes their monopoly stranglehold on the real-estate market.I'm not sure where I fall on what a real-estate agent's cut should be for selling a house. But for the buyer's agent, it's really over-valued IMO. And why should a buyer's agent in San Jose make 4x more than somebody in Des Moines for the exact same value-add?When I bought my house, my Realtor found some good listings, arranged viewings, did the paperwork, and set everything up for me.

What is not counted is the (much greater) inventory that is currently occupied, with rent-controlled tenants paying far less than market rate.When someone cites ""the unaffordability"" of rent in order to justify rent control, what you also don't see is the high cost of MOVING that comes with rent control.

A lot goes into it, it can get emotional, messy, and sometimes quite complicated. Having someone that does it on a daily basis can  be nice and really smooth things out.- people are too attached to their homes emotionally. More often than not, when trying to sell on their home without a realtor they will not have it in a saleable condition and price it too high for the marketplace. It will sit and not sell, or they will get an offer that is appropriate and be offended and not sell it.

I have a pretty thorough spreadsheet for modeling this kind of thing.Even if I had a 20% down payment, fully accounted for tax deductions, payment against principal, etc, and ignoring costs like maintenance, my lease in Seattle is significantly less than the monthly cost of a mortgage for the same place.This is true more often than people expect. Many landlords are not covering a mortgage payment as large as yours would be, or any mortgage at all, with your rent check. Their cost basis is not your cost basis so it is not unexpected that the market clearing price for rent is below the monthly cost for many people to buy the same property.	jandrewrogers	11.439126	3.6854036	comment	6.0	34.0	1471292451	-0.52049947

As a practical matter, that means that the rent increases track closely to inflation and consumer prices.What it protects isn’t rising rent, it protects tenants from landlords jacking up the rent to kick them out, and then lowering it back again to get tenants of a different age or ethnicity, or saddling tenants with the risk that if they advocate for their right	mattzito	11.351135	3.8427134	comment	6.0	43.0	1666398042	-0.6254454

We were going to give an offer at list price, but she could tell the selling agent was a bit desperate, so she was able to get it $100k below list price, something that is unheard of in the SF Bay Area.Overall she netted us $200k over both transactions, and she was singlehandedly the reason for this.

That reason is that NK is the buffer zone between China and the 30,000 US troops stationed in SK. Heck what about the 40,000+ troops stationed in Japan.NK was a pain in the rear end until G W Bush made them a target with the axis of evil thing.

It felt like it dwarfs London's tube.Criticisms? It was clearly at or near capacity, which I guess explains the rapid growth. There was a mass of security theatre, X-ray machines at the entrances to some (most?) lines but lots of people were just ignoring the attendants and walking quickly passed the machines without having their bags checked. It seemed difficult (impossible?) to pay with anything but cash, at least at the stations I visited all machines were cash only (I guess not so modern after all).	leejo	12.225731	3.8724399	comment	6.0	19.0	1495375058	-3.2620997

But it will have to be done.Maybe the biggest tragedy is that we are still building NEW houses that will have to be fixed in the future (except in the above countries and some others I no doubt missed).

It's just the bid up price of the good.Landlords and owners will be able to command high fractions of average incomes as long as there is no slack in the housing market. If you nationalize housing and hold prices low, then there will be supply shortages where some folks will not be able to get housing who would happily pay your price. (This is a fact, not conjecture, and is easily observed in any affordable housing lottery in the United States.)The only way to have low prices and also to satisfy the demand for housing (i.e. have each person who is willing to pay be allocated a unit) is to have slack in the market.

The Empire State Building, as an example, required 14 human sacrifices to build in 400 days (and likely many more injuries).

30892315	There are two problems with this ide	There are two problems with this idea. The first is that the existing housing stock is already occupied, and the people who occupy it don't have much incentive to go anywhere. If we could build a massive amount of new, high quality housing then in theory the demand for the older homes might decrease but in many places we're in such a deep supply hole that the necessary amount of new construction just isn't going to happen given the political environment. The second problem is that filtering takes time, but people need homes today. There's an argument to be made that it's in the public interest to allow for at least some units to be made available that are affordable to someone on a teacher's salary. Also, building homes at any price point is a good idea.	wan23	11.192806	3.745884	comment	6.0	43.0	1648939174	-0.7958436

25583819	This argument isn’t as solid as it s	This argument isn’t as solid as it sounds, mainly because you have to live somewhere. So you’re going to need to pay rent and you need to subtract that off the profits from S&P investments.You also generally can’t borrow 5x your income and invest it, but you can do that on a house, so if you think house prices will rise, even a tiny bit, then you’re missing out on a chance for major leverage you won’t get elsewhere. Hint: house prices don’t really go down much, because everyone is leveraged and literally can’t afford to sell below a certain point.Finally there’s something to be said for the security and ability to make a house your own. Not being dependent on a landlord’s whims and decisions can be of huge value.	albertgoeswoof	11.416797	3.6611245	comment	6.0	28.0	1609350213	-0.4881313

No-one in the UK worries about not being able to afford healthcare if they're poor, nor do they need a car to get to the grocery store in under an hour (unless they live in an isolated home out in the countryside, which probably means they're rich, not poor.) There are many, many places you can live in the UK without needing a car to get to work.The deposit thing looks insane to me too. My rental deposit is held in escrow by some third party; I've never heard of anyone not getting their deposit back when they move (unless they did something to deserve it e.g. trashing the place). The only issue around deposits is that you usually have to pay a deposit for the new place before you've received the deposit back 	blackshaw	11.309504	3.7199523	comment	6.0	30.0	1614595206	-0.6584019

Using the scarcity of housing to build wealth is just short-sighted and will always lead housing shortages because the housing value above construction cost is only maintained by way of scarcity.

I'd recommend the same to everyone.Tenants are a liability for landlords in SF. You cannot end a tenancy, not with any amount of notice. That's a big deal and a huge policy mistake. Really messes up incentives. Let's say you and your partner have a duplex with two 2B/2BA units. You eventually decide to have kids and your parents are retiring. You want them to move into that unit so they can be near and babysit now and again.

In many senses it's hardly ""fair"".I don't know what the answer is here; I see it as a tough policy challenge. There might very well not be a solution that's ""fair"" to everyone.

Given what I felt were going to be significant economic disruptions due to unemployment and drops in income, I prepared myself with the understanding that our little resort town was going to be facing some hard times.  Usually, small resort towns tend to take it on the chin when the economy turns.Boy was I wrong.Once the initial shock of lifestyle changes happened due to COVID, people FLOODED the area and any piece of real estate not bolted down was flying off the shelves and bought for cash unseen.

So you'll have more money on your hands if you drop your rents by one third rather than leave it vacant for a year. Of course, the actual effect would be smaller than one third since tenancy length is endogenous.However, this serves to illustrate: keeping rents high is rather a combination of being bad at mathematics, tacit collusion among landlords and protesting rent control.	ulucs	11.342625	3.8067143	comment	6.0	25.0	1606026142	-0.60708946

A Victorian house in the same area barely rents for more (£3400-600) but the mortgage with a 10% deposit would lose you money renting it out.This makes zero sense, but regularly happens.

And because housing values are so expensive, there's a tremendous amount of psychological pressure to ""preserve"" what they've purchased beyond their own property line (eg: ""Neighborhood character""). For these reason, they're going to oppose any new supply entering the market.The only way you're going to fix this problem for good is to have the government step in and force new housing supply into markets, which is going to be extremely unpopular with everyone, including most YIMBYs who would favor removing market barriers.

There's two reasons for this. Firstly, there's the obvious limit to how much you can build within a reasonable commute time with reasonable infrastructure at a good quality of life. Secondly, studies have shown that 10% increases in supply lead to 1% decreases in price, more or less.

If management costs are $100 per month that’s 10% of a $1,000/mo rent.Finally, there are costs like interviewing, turnover, payment risk, eviction risk, legal costs, damage exceeding security deposit risk, and trying to factor this in can dwarf the underlying carrying cost of the property. Some of these are likely to be inversely correlated with property value.	zaroth	11.370148	3.7336404	comment	7.0	51.0	1553360730	-0.55466795

19601871	Supply side markets work when they d	Supply side markets work when they defeat the power of hoarding. Pick any market, and if sitting on the item makes you money in the long term, rather than putting it to use then you have a monopoly problem of some sort.For a market to work, it must always be the case that using the item to cause some socially useful economic flow to happen is more profitable than sitting on it, or trading your hoard with other hoarders.

Many low income renters are paying 50% or more of their income on rent, that's not sustainable for the wider economy that relies on low skill labor to function, and the solution is not to have people commute 4h every day to clean an office, teach a class, or fight a fire.The housing market moves so much faster than wages ever will, and it seems having only some units rent controlled exacerbates the problem for units that aren't, so why not make every unit in the state a rent controlled unit?

""I never watch ads"" is a common catchphrase when decrying ads but again, ads exist because they work.The job of a realtor, and what they are incentivized to do, is to facilitate a transaction.

30144558	Rents have risen so much even outsid	Rents have risen so much even outside big cities that in some cases it's cheaper to just buy a Single Family Home (SFH), especially with low mortgage rates. In my area, it costs around $1600 to rent a 2BR2BA apartment in a good complex (no garage). 3BRs easily $1700+. SFH $1800+.A basic 1800 sqft 3BR 20 year old SFH with a 2 car garage is like $365K in the same area with 8+ rated schools. Its even lower if you don't care about schools. This brings your monthly PITI+HOA ex-utilities to like $1600 a month at 20% down (slightly higher now with interest rates going above 3.5%). Nice 2500 sqft ones at $450K.This is all in the past year. It wasn't this expensive to rent compared to buying pre-pandemic. My apartment rent went up like 15% when I renewed.	vsskanth	11.15469	3.7372458	comment	7.0	65.0	1643604223	-0.56294537

Lenders are more of an expert than myself on any issues in doing that, but it appears to happen in other states already. One of the problems of these lawsuits is the conflation of agency with payment.

That's $150K/year, mostly after tax (there's a bit of a deduction for interest but let's ignore that for now). Using the standard 30% rule, that means you should have a gross income of about $500K.What I'm questioning is, how many people are there with that income level to eventually sell these insanely expensive houses to? Sure you have a bunch of all cash offers but that eventually dries up as well right?Plus 4BR at 2000sqft isn't particularly spacious. And only two bathrooms at that size?

We want low taxes but we want high quality social housing.While the books of a country must be immensely complex, it can be distilled to a very simple money in, money out equation, and when a country is running at a higher money out than money in, you're getting into debt. Cutting this means cutting state funded things, from services to buildings, etc.It's not right to use dangerous materials, but if we have less money to spend, or if we prioritise things wrongly, things like this will happen.	imdsm	11.161418	3.7424636	comment	7.0	29.0	1498321199	-0.6624942

Your actual ""money that goes away like rent"" expense is the interest. When you use this as your comparison, a lot more rent-vs-buy decisions swing over to ""buy"". Of course you also need to factor in amortized taxes, maintenance, and so on, but mortgage principal is not an expense.EDIT: Plus, if you want to get even more exact, you should be comparing the interest portion minus the tax deduction to rent, because (at least in the US) the government lets you deduct mortgage interest from your income."	ryandrake	11.453591	3.6072485	comment	7.0	33.0	1653664038	-0.48938438

Housing has important asymmetries it's reasonable to address through legislation. One is asymmetry in scale: you have one unit; landlords have many more. This gives them stronger negotiating power. Another is cost of change. It's much more expensive for me in time and money to move than it is for a landlord turn over a new unit. That means a landlord can extract money well above a true market rate. A third is of interest. Individuals and the community have a interest in healthy social bonds, while absentee lords mainly want to extract cash.I understand free-market fundamentalists hate all rent control, but Oregon's rent control laws	wpietri	11.2078285	3.8720686	comment	8.0	79.0	1563630893	-0.5892278

I was under the impression (from Barbara Demick's book Nothing to Envy) that all North Koreans are more or less granted asylum by default. My recollection is that she put it even more strongly in her book: that SK in effect treated fleeing North Korean citizens as de facto citizens of South Korea, because they are meant to be one country. Is the asylum process mentioned here a rubber stamp, or did the process get more strict?

Your interest on your mortgage is tax free, the government offers cash back, etc. Renting gives most of these incentives to the landlord instead and they aren’t necessarily passed onto the renter. Most importantly, this means that if you have cash to invest, real estate has favorable tax treatment compared to other options so you suddenly have turned housing into a market that must rise decade over decade or the economy will collapse.The way to fix this is painful but it is to revoke all incentives and to make people put down 25-50% as down payments.

If they targeted retirement funds like they should... what happens? Housing bubble pops, retirement funds lose tons of money. They are busy attacking the oil industry because they know they cant extract anything out of Finance, Real Estate, or insurance.	incomingpain	11.429211	3.705591	comment	8.0	39.0	1649350900	-0.6207284

To the extent that it helps someone afford a home that they can save tax-free for it, the same is true of some of the people they're bidding against, driving up the price they ultimately pay for it. The government is just transferring their own future tax revenue to people who own homes, not people in the market for them.It seems that governments have a reflex of dealing with a supply crisis by showering money on the demand side (see also: gas tax decreases, higher education subsidies, etc.), which just drives up prices further.	paulgb	11.212275	3.6532667	comment	8.0	52.0	1649351721	-1.4670787

A homeowner sitting on a million dollar piece of property in California taxed at ~1% is still unlikely to build an apartment complex if they like their single family home just fine and are making $200k+/year in income.3) It could be personal bias, but a lot of LVT arguments seem to implicitly assume that more rental units is a good thing, which I don't really agree with.

Some of those reasons are subjective (not a lot to do in Ohio), and some are very objective (certain rural areas are extremely hostile to other groups of people).In major cities where people want to live (slash where well paying jobs are), it is very difficult to justify ownership.

Views are my own, BTW.I bought a house a couple years after I started working there, and I wanted the full home-purchaser experience. I used my company's services for everything, and as an employee they hooked me up with a real estate agent (among other things).I was honestly appalled at what little my real estate agent did for me through the whole process. I had what seemed like simple requirements: I wanted to live west of the city, I wanted at least 1 acre, and an outbuilding. The outbuilding is what threw off the search tool the agent was using to find houses for me; he rarely found good ones in my price range that had outbuildings.I ended up finding the house I purchased.

When people stop being able to afford the houses, or willing to pay high prices, guess what, the prices go down.

Hence you can't have both something that's scarce and affordable.That aside, the reason why people have been using housing as an investment vehicle is because there really aren't that many good investment opportunities over the long term. You have stuff like gold and stocks, but they have their own problems. Housing has the additional utility of the ability to live in it.I suspect that the reason housing/real estate wouldn't be considered such a great investment if there were a better store of value.	jimmysong	11.3396015	3.6938074	comment	8.0	54.0	1556754713	-0.5342445

If real estate really is returning greater than 0 real returns (not including rent/dividend) then that is quite concerning for society.  It means we haven't achieved any progress in housing for 150+ years (sure electricity/sewage/pipes, but that goes in a different category, more like utilities).

Increase supply at the same time and rents don't increase faster than inflation.Buying property and renting it out is expected to yield returns. There's nothing wrong with that. It actually increases access to housing by allowing people who can't afford to buy property to still live somewhere in the meantime. The problem is when you're not just buying a $200,000 house whose value tracks inflation and renting it out, but buying a $200,000 house as the value quintuples and all of that money goes to the landlord while the tenant's rent quintuples as well.

So far, I have spent about $5k per year on. Repairs etc. So effectively, I make about $20k after taxes, repairs, mortgage interest etc. Overall, I spent $350k by way of downpayment, mortage interest payment, etc. No major tenant issues.Hence, I would peg my return on investment of 5% if I do not account for increase in price of the house. If I do, it would be around 10% which is what FAANG has been giving me, with much less hassles.Decide for yourselves if this is passive enough for you.	throwaway088	11.344076	3.6562939	comment	8.0	54.0	1620665735	-0.49235907

A perfect storm of Millennials finally buying homes with low interest rates (?). COVID just jump started it.Who knows.

You can't just stop evictions while not compensating landlords, and not developing clear plans for what happens when the moratorium ends. No one is going to catch up on their rent of their behind. What I suspect will largely happen is many landlords will forgo a formal eviction as long as the tenants decide to leave voluntarily. Then those tenants will effectively swap houses with someone else who's behind, wiping the rental debt clean. You only understand this if you've gone through an eviction, but the vast majority of the time the landlord just want you to leave.

If I buy $100 worth of property, I have to pay tax on it again every year forever, which basically means I’m only buying the right to rent it from the government in perpetuity.Your use of the phrase “rent seeking” is also a bit weird. It sounds like any extraction of value from capital would meet your definition.

Also, there are hidden costs of home ownership not necessarily factored in for, like repairs, maintenance, etc that are just implicitly included in rent. Finally, one can use the savings from paying rent to invest in the stock market and generally get a higher return than real estate.	chrisco255	11.3964615	3.693966	comment	9.0	142.0	1560222733	-0.48328775

19401809	Money quote is as the end, from a Ma	Money quote is as the end, from a Max pilot:“Tecce did not fault the FAA for taking a wait-and-see approach. “A lot of people throwing a lot of rocks at the FAA. Since 2010 we’ve had one aviation fatality” in the United States. “Our safety record is astonishing,” he said. “I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the airplane. If you talk to the pilots who fly them, they’ll tell you it’s not the airplane so much as whether or not the manual properly describes what’s going on.””Seems more and more consensus is forming around this idea, that the MCAS system generally did what it was supposed to do, _and_ has an appropriate safety cutoff for the pilot if needed, but that Boeing did not focus a lot of attention on this new system in their training/documentation when in fact they needed to.	burlesona	11.13339	4.8414826	comment	9.0	57.0	1552669994	-9.678118

By doing so, we've encouraged people to commit a very large fraction of their net worth into a rather illiquid asset, tying their financial fates to the future assessment of that asset. As a result, protecting the price and appreciation of this asset has come to overshadow the other crucial roles that housing plays in our society.If I bought shares in AAPL at $50 (now $100+) and someone comes along asking that AAPL let them buy some shares for say, $65, I'm obviously not going to be happy since the value of my investment is under threat.

Things like government guarantees on mortgages to reduce the interest rate, mortgage interest deductions, property tax limits, and (yes) restricting the supply of housing through permits and zoning are all policies that serve to make housing a good investment, at the expense of affordability.

Economic Efficiency: Unlike income or consumption taxes, an LVT is non-distortionary. It doesn't discourage productive activities like work, saving, or investment. Land is a fixed resource; its supply doesn't change with price or tax fluctuations. Therefore, an LVT wouldn't distort market incentives, unlike other taxes. By shifting the tax burden onto land, we could potentially reduce the distortionary effects of other taxes and promote economic growth.2. Wealth Inequality Reduction: Land ownership in the U.S. is highly concentrated. A significant portion of the country's land is owned by a small percentage of the population.

But without a way to value the corresponding leasehold this change seems like it just distorts financials in a way that makes the data less useful.	zaroth	11.406113	3.7988455	comment	9.0	67.0	1510944642	-0.5497751
14614508	So I have two issues with this post.	So I have two issues with this post.1. It needs to separate out Vancouver and the rest. Vancouver is its own bubble of self-perpetuating nonsense propagated by Chinese money.2. The article states shares are better because companies can plow money back into the business, which completely misses the point because price rises aren't pure speculation. There is a HUGE labour cost in housing such that housing prices track inflation (particularly wage inflation).And that's the real value in property investment in periods like the 1970s that saw really high inflation.What's more land represents a largely non-renewable resource. Take Manhattan as a fairly extreme example. They're not making more land to put things on.

A tenant can easily pay rent two or three times, and then stretch out the eviction proceedings for 6 to 18 months depending on the state .If this person went and filed for a second bankruptcy, they could then delay the eviction by years.The bigger issue of course is we haven't built up enough new housing over the last 40 years, you want there to be so much available housing landlords can't be selective. They have to take the risk of losing a bit of money, because they're going to lose an absolute ton if they let their units remain vacant.	999900000999	11.437534	3.7851405	comment	9.0	135.0	1648569455	-0.581694

It'll be interesting to see how quickly that get absorbed in a market with rising interest rates and questionable valuations. There appears to be lots of demand but what I'm seeing in my corner of the world is most of the demand is at the lower end of the market, which I'm guessing isn't what is primarily being developed. People moving up does free up properties at lower ends of the market, so in effect, a trickledown effect, but that takes a while to happen. Maybe we're going to see more and more house sharing and renting of individual rooms (legal or not).	Mountain_Skies	11.293904	3.7394152	comment	9.0	68.0	1648570263	-0.59683526

Without building.The biggest problem in the country is that investment capital is swooping in any buying any valuable property up and re-selling it for a lot more OR renting it out for a lot.Because investment is just buying everything for cash, they don't really care.We need a massive tax on investment property, something that'll require the house to become completely unaffordable to re-sell, so investing will have negative returns due to taxation.Then suddenly a ton of houses will fly back on the market because investors will be trying to dump inventory.ALSO property taxes can help: If you live in a house, your property tax is identical to today. If you don't, your property tax is say 10x'd.Being a real-estate investor won't be very lucrative. Mea	Justsignedup	11.362028	3.6522493	comment	9.0	41.0	1663254861	-0.55792433

I’m hoping someone more knowledgeable might be able to set me straight.Prices on the coasts — like 5k rent — are astronomically high compared to prices in, say, the midwest. This shocks many people.You could easily make the same comparison between the midwest and some non-developed nation.  The difference is, nobody is shocked about how prices are higher in the USA midwest compared to an arbitrary less-developed country. Why is that exactly?I loathe these insane prices, but my question is: could it be reasonable to view these high prices as a /good/ thing, as a sign of development?	bigyikes	11.180248	3.5954657	comment	9.0	39.0	1657800643	-0.4782838

22119399	Housing as investment is a mindtrick	Housing as investment is a mindtrick, and a dangerous one at that.With it often comes property taxes. There's the time and cost of maintenance. There's the friction of being able to easily relocate for a better paying job.Worst of all, past performance is no indication of future returns. That is, it's possible your property won't appreciate, at least not sufficiently. For example, think Detroit. Or beachfront property in say 25 yrs. Or McMansions. Will smaller less consumption-minded families in the future want them?Housing works as an investment because everyone is in on the scheme. The gov. The banks. Everyone.

Either that person is you, and you are paying off your own debt; or that person is someone else, and you are paying off theirs.This article argues at great length for you to let someone else pocket all of that wealth rather than retaining some of it yourself.If you pay mortgage, there is hope that one day you will have paid it off and no longer have to.

On top of that, a lot of those buildings have large loans against them that may well become greater than the value of the buildings. The latter certainly feels like the sort of thing that could ripple through the economy as building owners have to sell off assets to make loan payments.	idopmstuff	11.248126	3.7687657	comment	11.0	69.0	1684679609	-0.6634647

38662116	Long long ago in a galaxy far far aw	Long long ago in a galaxy far far away when I was doing CS as and undergrad we had an assignment to build a model on how to maximise rental income for a commercial property. It was just a toy model but it showed that as you increased rent your vacancy rate would go up. Not surprisingly. But the interesting bit was you Maximised income at about a 15% vacancy rate. So in an unregulated market driven situation you would be leaving money on the table if you did not keep reaching prices until you priced some people out. It was a light bulb moment for me to see that this was a rational result even if it “felt” greedy to me. Now I think about these kind of issues as being unbalanced models.

So am I being hit twice by the potato price hike — once for me and then again for my landlord?In a fair world, renting a property is paying for the right to live somewhere and nothing more, but I feel like in the unfair world landlords feel entitled to rent as an income stream and as such when the potato price goes up they will ask for a “pay raise” (rent rise) to cover it.	gorgoiler	11.463187	3.6881814	comment	11.0	60.0	1658234460	-0.46789965

And one reason why there's so much pressure for home prices to keep going up.

In markets like NYC, where demand is ever-increasing and for various reasons supply cannot keep up with demand, maintaining rent-controlled apartments necessarily drives prices higher overall. This prices a large group of people (especially the working-class young) out of the market. At the same time, were landlords allowed to adjust to market at-will, people who potentially have lived in a community for decades could be displaced without notice. Both situations are undesirable, since it would seem that someone gets screwed either way.I've been w	beisner	11.234295	3.816731	comment	12.0	152.0	1526942257	-0.6601177

At that point, ownership can either remain with the bank (but with zero installments) or transition to the would-be borrower.About the only thing Arrived seems to be doing differently is allowing homeowners to change houses without affecting how much they're paying towards any house - in other words, you're really purchasing a subscription to a collection of homes.I find this latter concept intriguing, but hard to reason about competitively.

Either we limit Canada's crazy-high immigration rate (1% of population every year) or we build more homes which is mostly gated by illiberal zoning laws passed by municipalities. But both of these policies are very popular so you'll be swimming upstream, politically.While you're at it, you could go after other wildly popular policies that lead to high housing prices, like the primary homeowner capital gains tax exemption (probably, by value, the biggest tax dodge in the industrialized world), and Canadian cities' extremely low property tax rates (0.3% of assessed value in Vancouver, for example).

Sometimes developers will rent the units they build, but often not. Developers are the good guys here. When they build shiny luxury towers, it gives the Amazon tech bro something to buy instead of coming into your neighborhood and bidding up the price of older units.2.

The former starts a new job at Google in Mountain View, the latter starts a new job at a trendy start-up in downtown SF. Since they're paying significantly below market rate, they're unable to trade apartments with each other without paying a significant amount of money.So, because you cannot trade apartments without spending significantly more money, there's a couple of hour-long commutes instead.

I'd be responsible for upkeep (e.g. roof repairs), property taxes, that sort of thing.What I'm not understanding, though, is how this passes down.

The city also acts as a competitor, driving prices down by offering cheap flats.

My experience is that the board is not the problem - the non board sitting owners are.  Our complex was comprised of 5 separate 3 story buildings.  Three of those building had bad water leaking problems but when we tried to raise money for repairs - the people who weren't suffering any interior water damage wouldn't vote yes.  Many buyers don't read the fine print or dig into the boards finances before they buy.  We ultimately passes a special assessment but not without some serious ""log-rolling"" to get everyone on board.Nobody wants to pay for what is a collective problem.  Sometimes I think condo's shouldn't even be legal because of this.  They should all be apartments with a central management company.The solution is"	phlipski	11.203752	3.9864845	comment	14.0	63.0	1625250626	-0.64253056

12062591	Here's a dirty secret:You don't need	Here's a dirty secret:You don't need a real estate agent, particularly a buy-side agent. Look at the housing markets in the UK and Australia. Buy-side agents have never existed there, and are a particularly odd quirk of the U.S. market. When you close the deal you typically have a banker there, and ideally a lawyer. So what does the agent actually do? Drive you around to houses you have already previewed online?Being a real estate agent is no different than being an investment banker or a consultant. Realtors are deal-driven and therefore, not a true advocate for clients. If a client pays more for a house than they should, then the buy-side and sell-side agents make more commission. If a house sells quickly then it is less hassle for the sell-side agent. So to be fair, there is something o	dforrestwilson1	11.673709	3.6119158	comment	14.0	85.0	1468088432	-11.35717

Keeping in mind that while it's empty they earn nothing but still have some amount of cost for the property. A year+ of lost income is going to take a long time to recoup.The only ones I've found is in NYC where due to rent control it's expensive to convert a controlled rental unit into a co-op/condo so landlords have an incentive to empty out buildings and keep them empty until the conversion.	marcinzm	11.363495	3.8332207	comment	14.0	56.0	1617675061	-0.6143853

Whereas the laws we love to hate result in units getting stuck far below market for decades or even generations.The difference with this law is that a 20% rent hike will take 3-4 years to be implemented instead of 30 or 60 days.

The reason property here has become so valuable, and continues to become even more valuable, doesn't have that much to do with the individual contributions of the property owners.  Somebody has to own the real estate of the area, after all; from a societal standpoint it doesn't matter very much who that is.

27585392	Housing can either be affordable, or	Housing can either be affordable, or profitable, not both. Affordable means that the price of a house remains stable relative to inflation or wages. Profitable means it has to grow faster than inflation or wages. Everyone needs somewhere to live, therefore housing should not be profitable. You shouldn’t be able to make a tonne of money by just buying a house and sitting on it. Investing in housing should mean improving existing housing or building new housing.Here in Australia the government is talking about letting young people access our equivalent of their 401k to afford a deposit on a house. Without changing the supply of housing how is this anything other than another attempt from boomers to steal more wealth from their children so they can line their coffins with more gold.

This is especially the case in low-quality housing units near universities, where students generally don't live in a single place for more than a year or two.For example, one time a landlord didn't return the security deposit. I called him, messaged him, left notes in his mailbox. No reply. One month, two months went by. So, I looked up the relevant legal code, found the part that said ""landlords have 30 days to return the security deposit with any deductions listed. Failure to do so results in the landlord owing the tenant double the original amount with no deductions.""

This progressively gets worse and worse until university.In my father's generation, people could relax after getting into university. They could party around, barely pass and still get decent jobs. Nowadays, that's definitely not the case. Getting a good job is insanely hard. You need to take care of your GPA.

One of the ideas was a system of property tax system in which you pay property tax based on a property value which you get to declare (rather than some assessment by a third-party or government agency). The catch is that you are required to sell to anyone who offers your declared value. So a bit like a land value tax but fully general (can be applied to anything) and also sidestepping the issue of how to actually determine the the ""value"" in land value.While this would pose obvious practical problems as a system for property taxes, it seems like it might actually be a good system for patent taxes.

At the same time these people have access to the outside world, they have to know that there is a better opportunity for them outside. So why walk the line of the party?

Yet a landlord isn't allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.Even if the landlord insists on a contract abrogating this, it's unenforceable. Policy restricts this because 1) landlords generally have very high negotiation power, and 2) tenants rarely read the fine print. It seems to me that both conditions are approximately true for the major cloud providers.If you agree with tenant 	dcolkitt	11.418433	3.865217	comment	17.0	295.0	1610493800	-0.7598064

Any conversation about 'right', 'wrong', 'moral', it all goes out the window.It really sucks that so much of peoples' value is often tied up in a single property. It would be a gobsmackingly terrible investment decision, if you didn't need shelter to live reasonably well.So let's be clear. These people are being incredibly selfish, and that is reprehensible. But they also don't really have a good alternative that wouldn't lose them a lot of money in a time where, if they're not in the class that owns multiple houses, they're already struggling. And that is sort of ameliorating imo.	leggomylibro	11.281569	3.7045574	comment	17.0	278.0	1512176264	-0.58974856

Booming economy, transplants from other states, then the COVID factor. We also have a near free market on rent; I've been a landlord and not aware of any limitations. There are a couple limits on property taxes (namely a cap of 10% increase per year on ""homesteads"", and an Agriculture exemption for rural properties). But for most people in the towns and cities, this means our property tax bills have been growing 10% a year for probably the last 15+ years. So, the problem we're having now is people that have owned a home for decades or even just 5 years are finding they get forced to sell because they can't afford the tax bill. Since housing has appreciated, they're not just forced to"	conductr	11.284262	3.6702409	comment	17.0	105.0	1707583258	-0.625426

You have suburbs full of families that will never move out, and if they do move out, will just rent the building out rather than selling.The indirect effect of that is that prices go up, but you're really just seeing that the commuter belt of semi-detached homes is full and that's that.It's common to talk about knocking down home	esotericn	11.177374	3.7670271	comment	17.0	189.0	1541895612	-0.5761448

Housing (aka shelter) is a key part of that but the way the US does this is completely backwards.The government saying you can't evict someone is basically telling people they don't have to pay rent anymore regardless of need. Rent control is the same way: you can't raise the rent regardless of need. So these programs don't really help people in need: they help market incumbents.This is the government foisting welfare onto the private sector rather than doing it properly.If the government didn't want people evicted due to pandemic circumstances, what they should do is assess this on a case-by-case basis and pay the rent for people in genuine need.The Internet is full of stories of people who just stopped paying re	cletus	11.351054	3.7833972	comment	17.0	80.0	1642612730	-0.646719

The widespread ownership of property is arguably the foundation of democracy. Owning your home gives you rights and independence; your home is your castle. The landlord's home is their castle.Now we are concentrating wealth and property back into the hands of a few, a corporate aristocracy. You can use property at their pleasure. What happens if you want to do something politically unpopular? Put a sign in your yard? Work someplace or say something on social media? What if you have a dispute with this landlord - can you compete in court with their lawyers? where else will you live?

This would include- heavily taxing capital gains owning land (not taxing the improvements)- limiting ownership to a very long lease (e.g. 99 yrs) similar to what they do in Singapore.Both would be highly politically unpopular for the majority of Americans and therefore they do not get implemented. What people don't realize is that fixing the housing problem actually requires certain people to GIVE UP something:- giving up the quality of your nice neighbourhood because a giant complex was built next door- giving up mu	aiisahik	11.169944	3.820009	comment	19.0	133.0	1674713845	-0.62538564

I talked with multiple agents and never got a sense of them doing much to push the house other than listing it on MLS and coordinating showings. For the seller agent, they didn't even really want to be at the showings -- they'd just provide a lockbox and give the code to the buyer agent. So where is the value there? On a median home sale, the seller side agent/broker  is netting $12,400.

Properties are bought up to be flipped, added to the short term rental market, and/or bought as secondary/tertiary homes.  I can think of a few things that would work toward resolving this that would not destroy existing homeowners.1.  Statewide bans on short term rentals2.  Huge increase in short term rental taxes to the point where it's barely profitable3.  Adjustable property taxes based on vacancy.  Something like a 5x property tax multiple for 50% vacancy and scaling down to 1x for 5% vacancy.These proceeds should go toward a public/private partnership to build more housing.	parkingrift	11.2351	3.7991703	comment	20.0	125.0	1658768032	-0.6149149

This is leading to rising rents and rising home prices.In Seattle, for example, many (newly) wealthy Chinese people are buying houses purely for investment purposes. I know some of them. One of them has purchased 10 houses, and lives in only one of them (when they are in the states).  They've made millions on just this speculation.In the short term, this means housing prices are absurd. In the long term, when these houses are no longer appreciating in value at such large scales, we can expect a crash in the housing market.

It's not impossible to imagine their model working: why couldn't you serve as a market-maker for homes at a large scale, especially with the unique insights Zillow could have based on their datasets.However I think where the hubris lay is in how they thought they could leapfrog all the way to an automated solution before building a competency as a house-flipping company.From what I understand, where they failed was partly in building a rich enough model to properly account for the less easily quantifiable elements which ultimately account for a property's value. 	skohan	11.621477	3.6752589	comment	21.0	191.0	1638023117	-12.047026
34758464	I used to think that if average inco	I used to think that if average income cannot afford the average home, the market must necessarily correct. I’m wrong about this obviously but I still cannot understand why. I understand that wealthier people have vacation homes, but the only reason for a wealthy person to purchase an additional non-vacation home is to rent it out to someone less wealthy. Since the less wealthy person couldn’t cover the mortgage to begin with, the investment will be cash flow negative. The only hope is price appreciation which logically should never materialize.	osigurdson	11.333897	3.6865945	comment	21.0	86.0	1676165128	-0.5597764

High housing prices could be ""fixed"" almost overnight, but for almost every citizen of the first world, their house is the single biggest investment they will ever make in their life. You'd be destroying everyone's retirement plans and there'd be major economic repercussions.But there's also the second-order problem which is the people who realize that governments will never let the value of housing decrease because of the above, so you have upper middle class people owning ""investment ho"	mjr00	11.302269	3.6848361	comment	21.0	143.0	1678123087	-0.59655386

I was in that position for a while. Every time it seemed like I could afford to put that money down, the housing prices went up! It took a handful of years of renting cheap places (with roommates), living with my parents when I could and getting a few raises at work that I could finally save up enough for a down payment.	dfxm12	11.392099	3.607916	comment	21.0	221.0	1678123511	-0.51124734

I'm naturally going to go onto rental search sites and look at what similar houses in the area are renting for, and probably ask something pretty close to that.I would assume this is not illegal because it's using public information and not colluding with any competitors on price.But subscribing to a service that uses an algorithm that does basically the same thing is (might be) illegal? Does it cross the line when I explicitly agree with competitors that we'll all use the same algorithm? Or if we're all just independently using the popular pricing service could that become illegal? Or if the service agreement requires me to not rent for less than their algorithm calculates?	SoftTalker	11.490784	3.7013545	comment	21.0	222.0	1709424186	-0.5879603

Every open house I go to is packed and has an offer deadline at noon the day after (they aren't bluffing - it goes straight to under contract the next day). It's impossible to have any contingencies - even home inspection. Most are going for $50-$100K over asking. This is even with 7% interest rates, the stock market down 20% and tens of thousands of layoffs in my relatively tech (and Amazon) heavy area. The rental market is so tight - there's basically nothing on the market and the few dilapidated homes that go for rent are between $5-7k/mo.

Owning your own home is, in my view, the first step towards financial freedom.Downvote away but i strongly believe this concept is horrible.	yrgulation	11.27499	3.7221243	comment	23.0	209.0	1618906328	-0.65107137

They unlock doors.Who are real estate agents? We can all think of a few real estate agents, none of them are top performers. They are usually on their ~4th career before the age of 30. They are the type of person to wear a suit in public to pretend that it makes them important.I know an exception to the rule, except he sells multi-family real estate, and owns ~10 single family homes himself.  I'd hardly call him a real estate agent at this point, he is a landlord.	hospitalJail	11.672268	3.6182466	comment	25.0	159.0	1688127226	-11.371733

The people that are really getting screwed are 10 years old today: when they try to move out of Mom and Dad's they will enter a market with vastly reduced supply since nobody has any incentive to move.This is why if you're 19 you can't afford to live in Manhattan: you're either old (and lucky) or rich.	el_nahual	11.193985	3.8573966	comment	26.0	380.0	1614715693	-0.6407319

Each year you can offset your rental income against deprecation of the property and property taxes - meaning, you pay no income tax on your rental income.~30 years later, you've deprecated it down to an effective value of $0, so you hypothetically would have to start paying taxes on your rental income(of course, you can still deduct property taxes against that). What do you do?

An investment is only an investment if you expect a positive return over time. We generally want that investment to match or exceed inflation.(2) That's antithetical to the idea of affordable housing. It's either affordable or an expensive, appreciating asset. It literally cannot be both at the same time. The only reason it's worked thus far is the broad-based expansion of the US economy and of specific population centers like SF has masked the problem for many, many years. Especially in conjunction with 30-year mortgages requiring 2% down. That's s	arcticbull	11.296098	3.731101	comment	30.0	247.0	1575294349	-0.5116925
