26489481	> NFTs are actively doing harm to th	> NFTs are actively doing harm to the environmentI think there is a few misunderstanding here that are worth clarifying. Proof-of-Work blockchains are actively harming the environment due to mining activities. How much energy miners spend on the network is mostly a function of the crypto currency price, not the number of transaction.Secondly, NFTs can easily be minted on Proof-of-Stake blockchains that do not rely on miners and have little impact on the environment (and have very low gas fees, so that would also be beneficial for buyers and sellers).My point is: Proof-of-Work is the actual environmental disaster, not NFTs.(Note: I think that NFTs are an absurd and stupid concept that is completely overhyped)	dgellow	3.7002301	1.476857	comment	3.0	14.0	1615980074	-14.584169

This is equivalent to a print which can be reproduced indefinitely.The NFT is essentially just the artists signature on a print.  It’s literally the artist signing a hash of the content.The storage location of the content isn’t important.  It’s really just part of the history of the artwork.The owner only needs to keep a copy for their own collection, and can put it online themselves if they like.The NFT will verify that the owner bought a signed copy from the artist regardless of where the JPEG is actually stored at the time.I’m not commenting on how we should value this - just that the storage location going away doesn’t seem to be a showstopper.	zepto	3.6920722	1.4708179	comment	3.0	12.0	1616000644	-14.599973

If you can create NFT's such that transfer requires two signatures (one of those being the jurisdiction of the real property) then it would function little different than how property transfers happen today. Furthermore NFT transfers signed by the court could reduce or eliminate the costly need for title searches and title insurance. If real property moves to the block chain in this manner all you need is one final title search, then signed by the court, from then on out title can be ensured by the blockchain.

However, like a paper certificate that you might hang on your wall, the actual certificate is worthless. It is representative of something that may have value, e.g. proof that someone who owns the Brooklyn Bridge has transferred ownership to you. What matters is if other people believe the underlying item is worth something and accept control of the token as being sufficient to authenticate you as the owner. Obviously, in this case no one will accept this token in place of a deed for the bridge, but on the other hand if a government	wan23	3.6939745	1.4737374	comment	3.0	11.0	1616363633	6.840158

If each thing is unique, there is no overall market price. Price quotes are anecdotal. There are ""indexes"" which list prices for transactions, but that doesn't mean you can sell at that price.- Liquidity is very limited. This works like collectables. Try to unload a million dollars worth of Beanie Babies. It may pay off as a way to monetize fame. Taylor Swift, who has a very good understanding of how to monetize followers, may bring it off. Mark Cuban and his basketball team are doing fine with it. If you have fans, this works.

That is why NFT and video games are a perfect combination, possibly industry changing.Think of it in terms of an operating arcade. A video game NFT is like a special physical token only you can own (or maybe limited numbers of them) and when you drop it into a game, it gives you a unique item, exchanges for currency in-game, etc. If this is what GameStop is doing, they could be the backbone for all of this - the token machine at the arcade.

What stops developers today from implementing publicly documented formats for in-game elements? What stops other developers from writing code to import these elements from one game to another? All an NFT adds is a verifiable signature and a pubic database. The signature bit seems completely irrelevant. Why would one game developer care if did or did not pay a different developer? If it's the same developer, they already have some way to track that you bought the items. The public database is more useful here, but all this data is usually sitting on your local disk anyways. Devs could make use of it today if they were so inclined.	yed	3.69387	1.4705123	comment	3.0	20.0	1641456210	-14.609511

Just... add a separator token (say `#`) and a content hash (say with `sha1:` prefix, urn-style) to the end of the URL that's already in NFTs.I don't really understand why NFT's don't already do this.

You buy a ticket digitally and the barcode is scanned on your phone. Back in the days, fans liked to have a paper ticket they could have to remember the event, maybe their birthday or some record breaking play happened. The NFL is now selling commemorative paper tickets for a specific game to fans that is essentially an NFT. The fan had to have purchased the actual ticket and attended in order to buy the commemorative ticket.	donarb	3.6935496	1.471059	comment	3.0	11.0	1641826136	-14.629179

With something like cs:go there was a substantial secondary resale market for things like skins, which valve wasn’t able to capture but with NFTs they could have taken say 10% of each resale.2. Because the data is public it’s possible for other games to bootstrap off the data (we have seen this with “airdrops” in the crypto land). Meaning a game which is coming out can give some perk to people who own X in fortnite because they think their game is similar and want to entice people to try their game, especially people who they know like fortnite.In the tech world we are always talking about how valuable data is.

There are plenty of judges that disagree with you.Further, there are more benefits to using a blockchain than proof of ownership. You can tokenize your new non fungible assets, transfer them permissionlessly, use them as bearer credentials, etc.Not trying to be offensive here, but you and others in this thread are thinking way too small about the potential usecases of NFTs.

Buying a digital videogame allows me play it, even though there is no physical good (and is also a questionable definition of ownership due to DRM).Buying an NFT allows me to...show off I guess? It entirely separates the ownership from the ability the experience the owned thing, which I find bewildering. To me, 100% of the value of owning something is the ability to experience it.

The image could be copied off the blockchain onto a flash drive without changing the artistic value of it.To me, the portions of a thing that are ""art"" are attributes that change the artistic value of a thing.

When the creator perceives 'art-theft' as a problem, they can always resort to using a third party watermarking service. The NFT itself has no such anti-copying measures.

It would take a special kind of device to do that, one whose behavior is more complex than any yet created.This is just getting it wrong. Modern neural networks run as vectorized operations on a GPU. They are efficient because they do not use a single device to act like a single neuron, they can do massively parallelized work by optimizing for the hardware we have. If we had memristors, it doesn't seem like GPUs are the first thing they'd replace. More likely they wo	lacker	2.9929073	1.4654129	comment	3.0	18.0	1601592223	15.578023

It doesn't work as a liberating medium. At best it works as a useful temporary measure for poorly run inflationary countries. Instead of being at the mercy of a commercial or central bank, you are at the mercy of a small range of individuals who either hold almost all of the cards or develop and thus determine the monetary policy of the coin in question.

The NFT owner can't really claim to own any real ""thing"" in and of it's own right.The application owner gains very little – they could just implement a Plan Old Database within their system.The owner of the ""NFT"" gains very little – except the theoretical value of a token they could trade, and might have value, as long as it's backed with some capability provided by the application.None of this applies to things like ""a gif on the internet"", for which the NFT means exactly nothing if "	polemic	3.6930585	1.4720615	comment	3.0	11.0	1633059587	-14.608037

There is a market for baseball trading cards, but everyone is fully aware that they’re still just arbitrary prices of printed cardboard.

That value is decided by what people think the value is. I don't understand art, especially not ""high-art"", but somehow people value it, that's fine by me, people like different things.This is conceding the author's point: a hash on a blockchain has no innate value and being the purest form of a fiat currency with weak backing means that nobody has a strong reason to need them.

The NFT is the control of the token on the blockchain. Likewise, anyone could download the bytes of a 3D model of a weapon or hat in a video game. The only difference is that Valve’s software will check the canonical source of ownership, which isn’t much different than if Twitter or any other social network writes code to verify the ownership of an NFT representing some profile picture.	tshaddox	3.6757607	1.4521195	comment	3.0	19.0	1637351068	-14.608198

They play those games across platforms and sometimes even you play a game after the owner of the game changes-- someone buys the publisher, the developer, or they go out of business.

On the other hand art is really just about status and signaling, and it makes sense that they would convert more easily into this world."	baby	3.7029562	1.4722363	comment	3.0	21.0	1640134068	-14.603528

NFTs most people have seen/heard of are just links to a JPEG with little to no utility. That has caused all the hype/OpenSea volume, but there are many interesting crypto projects that ascribe utility to NFTs (but are also much less accessible).Interesting NFTs are those that: prove identity, serve as a key to a private community, yield tokens with utility, prove ownership of an asset that generates royalties, augment a gaming experience, etc.What's unique about how NFTs solve existing problems is fundamental to crypto - the data layer is open source, so everything is composable. Maybe the folks here working for large cap tech firms in effort to monetize proprietary data are offended by that.	timcott	3.6962361	1.4717389	comment	3.0	11.0	1640281625	-14.600871

There are probably going to be dozens of these NFT platforms, and I don't see many natural dynamics that would cause one to come out ahead (unlike with money).2. Owning the physical version of something gives you a meaningful monopoly over certain uses of the item (exhibiting the painting, wearing the shoes, etc.) whereas NFTs only give you access to one monopoly (bragging rights).

Web3 culture has made this quite difficult in practice. For example, it's quite normalised to say ""new exciting nft project, only available to existing owners of expensive nfts"". This sort of thing is considered an ownership perk. And it's why those discord hacks were so damaging, a statement like that was made and it did not sound out of character. So in order to use this service, you must be using the wallet with your expensive nfts, so ownership can be verified, but also because it's a phishing site.Edit: and if you wanted to routinely transfer small funds to a hot wallet, gas fees will put a stop to the idea."	technion	3.6948955	1.4701416	comment	3.0	11.0	1655328927	-14.611202

Unfortunately, we already have much more effective and well-regulated systems to handle both of those situations, and I'm at a loss for any circumstance in which an NFT would be better and also guaranteed effective.	danudey	3.6936464	1.473224	comment	4.0	20.0	1622741946	-14.607027

It's possible to imagine incentive structures that could make it happen, but the reason we don't have it at the moment isn't because NFTs haven't been around, it's because those incentive structures don't exist, or don't exist to the right extent.	kybernetikos	3.695792	1.4708698	comment	4.0	19.0	1641807604	-14.598889

It isnt the actual material.  It could be a hash and ownership information, but the illegal material need not be in the NFT.  Hashes for such material are not illegal.  In fact there are databases full of such hashes in use by file hosting services to detect and remove such things.  Owning an associated NFT would be like owning an NFT for ""cocaine"" but never being anywhere near real cocaine.  It may be worthless, but i dont see how it would be actually illegal."	sandworm101	3.6932592	1.4705776	comment	4.0	13.0	1641821092	-14.610909

Sure if it’s $100 good luck getting any movement or if it’s from a guy in Iran also good luck getting any recourse but if it’s from a guy in Georgia (the US state) don’t I have the same small claims court infrastructure as if I bought a used PlayStation from him?

 As someone who’s dabbled in the art world, I think people underestimate how important provenance is to an art piece. Having a decentralized system that can automatically keep a paper trail and is seamlessly connected to an automated market/auction service is mind blowing for the art world. It’s basically automating two entire sub industries: the auction houses, and the appraisers. The NFTs don’t even need to stay digitally to be useful.

Earlier ApeFest events were only for BAYC holders and had a celebrity lineup. This time they sold tickets to anyone.BAYC is the top end of NFTs. Almost everything else is worse.

Online tournaments could check your ownership of cards via the blockchain, and I can even see IRL tournaments checking the blockchain too, if you want to print a copy of your card.They already do this sort of thing with MtG Online, I think you can purchase and trade cards in-game.

This ownership and permission can then be moved around (potentially for large sums - potentially for near-zero amounts) by means that are independent of the client used. So for instance an NFT could give me access to an exclusive Discord channel (the client here being a Discord bot) and I could potentially sell or otherwise pass that onto someone else who wants access. The ownership of that token could also afford me access to, for instance, buying another token on another smart contract (the client here being another smart contract).That they are commonly linked to meta	JofArnold	3.6931872	1.4712634	comment	4.0	23.0	1634123345	-14.603527

I don’t understand what Ubisoft is doing here.The best case I can make for NFTs is securing ownership of digital assets. Let’s say I spend a few thousand on the Steam store. Then for some reason I charge back a transaction on my credit card. Valve will instantly ban me and I lose access to everything. Now if there was instead a system where my ownership was recorded on a token outside of valve’s control and that ownership entitled the holder of the token to access the game in perpetuity, that would be useful. Maybe.But even I’m not convinced by this. Steam and other digital stores like Kindle are already hugely successful. It’s possible  that people would spend more on digital goods if their ownership was irrev	nindalf	3.6948824	1.4698833	comment	4.0	12.0	1638984106	8.5259905

It’s always the same theme, oh this stuff is silly, oh and it’s destroying our planet too, what a terrible thing. The tone comes off as we’re here to tear down a side effect of decentralized authenticity and once exposed as a sham, we’ll go ahead and attack the technology itself.. it’s frustrating is all and counterproductive if you ask me. FWIW, I think the value of NFTs are ridiculous but the idea is cool.

Collect a rare trophy in Fortnite and show it off in your Steam VR Home, the trophies uniqueness and legitimacy verifiable by everyone. Of course, achieving this is easier said than done, but an appealing vision for the future of gaming.Also, it has historically been difficult for digital artists to get paid well, considering that copying their work is easy. I'm all for changing that. Yes, the image can still be copied, but ownership is it's own thing and some people are willing to pay for it.	kharak	3.6994557	1.4678981	comment	5.0	20.0	1622713992	-14.608927

If you own the domain and the server that it points to, the registrar can take the domain away from you and give it to someone else.In a sense, NFTs are a lot like those schemes we used to see where some company will promise to name a star after you, even though no one recognizes their authority to do this.

If you have that piece of paper you know that A) No one can have the same piece of paper without having that actual paper and B) no one can fool someone else they have that same paper (based on the ID). NFTs have nothing to do with URLs (although some NFTs do have URLs inside of them), the main point is to have something with a unique ID that is unique within that specific blockchain.	capableweb	3.6929746	1.4707912	comment	6.0	51.0	1641823283	-14.613105

That's the value right there. At the very least, holding an NFT gives you the ability to transfer it to someone else and make them the holder. Anyone can confirm that you did in fact transfer it and made the other person the holder.In addition, you potentially get access to other benefits, such as acceptance of some alternate meaning in the NFT social circle as well as potential benefits in software written that respects the NFT.What seems to have taken off most is that the NFT social circle will accept ownership of some linked item within the NFTs data.

29883678	Has anybody ever thought of somethin	Has anybody ever thought of something like a real world NFT? Imagine if you took a bunch of dried plant pigments and mixed them with oil and smeared them onto a canvas. Because it is physical it couldn't be duplicated or double-spent and it has a simple materials-based minting cost. I don't think anybody has done this before and there is probably a large market for buying and selling something like this. These are early days.	shiado	3.6916156	1.4611132	comment	6.0	27.0	1641853445	-14.614467

At a minimum, the vast majority of NFT transactions do not allow people to buy and sell ownership of digital art. They allow people to buy and sell ownership of the NFT itself. Unless you consider the token itself art, this is a very different proposition.People come up with all sorts of complicated metaphors for what NFTs are, but at the end of the day, they are digital tokens. That's it. An NFT is not the digital art that it may be notionally connected to.	thrwy_918	3.6930141	1.4694916	comment	6.0	38.0	1642692749	-14.608615

But that already happened, you missed out on it, and it has no bearing on their future prospects. And if a bunch of people ever feel the need to cash out at once, they'll find out just how much value they really have when there's nobody buying.NFTs are Collector's Edition items: Their original purchase prices are artificially inflated (normally by distributor's decision, for NFTs by wash trading).

Not completely, but certainly some of that spend now goes on apps right?).So for people who have grown up in a digital-subscription world, they might just have a fundamentally different mental model of ownership - one which is more compatible with NFTs as a reasonable idea than the paradigm us old ‘thing	jameshart	3.694382	1.4701694	comment	6.0	33.0	1633092805	-14.61233

NFTs can represent digital assets that exist fully on a blockchain and aren’t tied to off-chain assets.

I've been working on a project that is an interactive NFT art project, where the interactive capabilities of the art are only possible for the owners of the piece. Providing authorization to the service is as simple as verifying ownership of the token. It's been pretty fun, I used an open source game engine as both the art generative tool as well as the interactive HTML5 app that allows for users to interact with their art.That, and utilizing wallets as proof of identity, is so mindnumbingly simple compared to OAuth+OIDC for authentication and varying strategies for authorization.

1. Prove you own it;

1. The party certifying your ownership is not the government, but the consensus rules of a blockchain;
2. The thing you own is not physical, but digital in nature;
3. Your ownership does not prevent anyone from copying the file itself for their own uses.Regarding your point that the object you own might not be consistent: because of the cost relative of storing data on a blockchain, the actual digital thing you own isn't usually stored on the blockchain, but a hash of that file (e.g. [1]).

Art is just a very superficial and speculative application, and has become synonymous with NFT, fueled by craze and media attention. It's akin to someone saying an electronic device is another word for tamagotchi.I know this tech gets a lot of hate on HN, and I resonate with a lot of it, but I'm also trying to see beyond this gold rush. What I find interesting and promising is the ability to give uniqueness to THINGS in the digital world (not art necessarily), and to do so in a decentralized manner so that anyone can build applications that integrate those things i	gnrlst	3.692386	1.4669654	comment	7.0	26.0	1642692181	-14.609162

There can be multiple NFTs that claim to be tweets. There's no naturally definitive ""twitter"" token, unless it's managed by Twitter itself. But you're relying on the issuer of the coin to say ""I am the NFT coin"" and everyone to agree.Real world NFTs (e.g. art and collectibles) are unique in that there is no dispute about what the original is.

Wouldn't it be nice if the artist could benefit from that belated appreciation?Like most other things on the blockchain you don't really need the blockchain to do this, however this is one case where it's actually much simpler to implement the concept using a blockchain and smart contracts rather than any traditional method I'm aware of."	habosa	3.6312263	1.5320482	comment	9.0	40.0	1622712938	-14.608073

I don't understand why it's anything other than some code (written on a blockchain) saying you own this.  But people can just copy whatever you own (assuming it's digital like an image).  And if it's a physical thing with an NFT attached to it, why is an NFT better than a certificate of ownership?I guess a better question is: what problem does an NFT solve?

The NFT points to a content hash, and the content is uploaded to the Internet Archive (and they're compensated for the storage) as part of the NFT minting process.Your ownership is now on a distributed ledger, with a cryptographic hash of the content, paired with long term storage of said digital artwork. The Internet Archive's costs are ~$2/GB to store content in perpetuity, which seems insanely cheap to carve off as part of a transaction (Eth gas fees aside).	toomuchtodo	3.6914155	1.4699615	comment	11.0	128.0	1641600888	-14.603881

The reason why NFTs are currently hot is because there's a gold rush and people fear missing out. I don't think anyone who buys an NFT wants that NFT; they just hope to flip it for more money than they spent, or maybe diversify their portfolio (use it as a store of value). I could be wrong of course, but I seriously doubt it.Which means, the technical solutions to the questions raised in the original article this responds to, will probably not have time to be implemented before the rush is over.Also, one of the main points of the first article, if not the main one (and certainly the first one) is that centralization is a feature, not a bug.

It seemed like the logic translation of collectibles from the phyiscal world into the digital world.If an artist makes a painting, that original painting has collectible value.  If the same artist makes copies of it, those copies have less value.  That seems to make sense to most people.Now imagine if an artist makes a digital painting.  Is that work of art any less meaningful or valuable?  Of course not.  But there's been no way to define an ""original"" in the digital art form, and so there's been no way to assign collectability to digital works of art.  NFTs seem to provide a way for an artist and fans to collectively agree that some digital object is the original, and to treat it as such.The bonus is that it provides another avenue for digital artists to m"	fpgaminer	3.6934521	1.4699974	comment	14.0	83.0	1622740789	-14.612026
