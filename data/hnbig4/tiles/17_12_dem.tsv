Even taking a pretty conservative approach of only paying $1K/mo UBI to the citizens over the age of 18, that's 307M * .75 * $1K * 12 or $2.75T. US Federal tax revenue for 2021 was just over $4T.So, even with a fairly paltry UBI, you're talking about UBI representing an increase of taxes of almost 70% of total federal taxes.Make the UBI $1500/mo per adult citizen and UBI costs more than every dollar of federal tax received currently.Pay the $1K UBI to every resident of the US and UBI represents basically 100% of current federal tax receipts.	sokoloff	13.7187605	6.9285326	comment	3.0	13.0	1665443169	3.8210514

You can argue that's a bad goal if you want, but expecting everyone to continue working despite receiving free money is kind of missing the entire point of handing out that money.Btw, just because people act a certain way in a short period of time (especially during a time that was so out of the ordinary) that doesn't mean they'd act the same way for ~half a century.

Short of near-total redistribution, it's impossible to provide a decent level of UBI for everyone. Total redistribution doesn't work, because economy needs markers as ways of price / demand discovery, and markets apparently lead to power-law distribution, not flat.IMHO, the realistic option is a thick enough safety net for those who is going through a rough spot, for the disabled, etc, via both taxes and charity. But the vast majority will have to work, in one way or another, until machines completely take over, like in the Culture books by Ian Banks.	nine_k	13.71855	6.9292703	comment	3.0	13.0	1666052490	-15.896233

A big portion of the UBI will end up at the banks because basically the loans are guaranteed by the government.	zazaalaza	13.718968	6.9307613	comment	3.0	16.0	1583435578	-15.894412

But it's not enough that you can go to a doctor and eat.  It's sure not enough that you can pay rent so you can get off the street.If you make it $1000/month, now it's enough money to actually help people.  But it also costs $3 trillion a year.

A UBI also allows people to collect it while doing things like educating themselves, or doing unpaid work like taking care of aging relatives.There is an argument to be made for job guarantee programs on the basis that they're cheaper, since you get some useful labor out of people who might otherwise be unemployed. But in my view that doesn't outweigh the disadvantages.	anchpop	13.721025	6.9325647	comment	3.0	21.0	1589618240	-15.896046

It doesn't matter whether people have financial incentives to do work, because people /do no work/. You don't tax labor income to finance UBI, because nobody will have labor income; all taxes will be on capital of some sort, such as land or securities, and such taxes would be sustainable because all income will accrue to capital and none to labor.	hx87	13.721129	6.931446	comment	3.0	29.0	1470623194	-15.896195

The whole system is being taxed away at 1% per month to pay for the UBI. If you spend, lend, or invest your money as soon as you get it, you never pay taxes.There's a neat equilibrium here. UBI is put in, but slowly being taxed away while it sits. If your account is zero, you're not paying any tax, and the account grows quicker.

Then someone who makes $1k/month from other sources might pay $500/month in tax, thus reducing their effective, net UBI payment. (note, I made up these numbers completely off the top of my head)Someone who makes much more than that would also pay much more taxes.So in the end, UBI needs to be accompanied with some sort of tax reform, and isn't just about sending out checks to everyone (including Warren Buffet) on top of the existing system.	carpdiem	13.7209835	6.9324207	comment	3.0	15.0	1495815684	-15.925034

All I see is prices going up for anything and everything in population centers.Only option for people who want the benefit of UBI (i.e. freedom to do whatever they want and not worry about working for a living) would be to move in smaller cities/towns where the demand for the housing is already low enough that price hiking wouldn't make sense.I also feel like UBI would divide the world even more wealth wise.

Typically, unskilled managers and executives will forge the deal FIRST, and then go get the expertise and skilled laborers after.Startups are an exception to this rule, since the technology is all so new.

Maybe in 5 or 10 years we'll look back and decide it didn't improve stuff and we'll roll it back, but that's OK.

The dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, vehicles, computerized booking, and many other pieces of technology have replaced the need for many additional workers.The problem is that, as states, we are not translating these increased profits into increased quality of life for citizens. UBI is the most obvious way to start doing it.What we want is to in effect charge companies in relation to how much profit they're making off replacing workers (increasing productivity). When a company is able to replace 10 workers with technology, they should pay at least enough taxes for 5 workers to live off UBI. Repeat until everyone that wants to can live comfortably off UBI. While other people voluntarily work to make a lot more money than UBI.	earthtourist	13.718853	6.9297986	comment	4.0	51.0	1586369272	-15.896653

Time is a more fundamental economic concept than money.UBI is essentially just socialist redistribution policy in a different guise, and all it will do is obscure (but of course not erase) existing incentive structures.	valvar	13.711981	6.914101	comment	4.0	38.0	1608979124	-2.3591285

If UBI pushes inflation up, changes elsewhere can push it down.

It's a wealth redistribution. That is, many people will see their income go down under UBI (probably most HN readers for example). The money supply will represent the same amount of wealth, what changes is who owns that wealth and as a result who decides how to use that wealth to consume.Regarding price changes, price is set by the amount of a good/service demanded by consumers, and the supply of the good/service created by suppliers.

This is demonstrably false, especially if individuals don't have a day job. On an individual level it's easy to say that people should be responsible for their own wellbeing. But as a matter of public policy, it's just plain bad policy.It's also hard to see how that money would /not/ be extracted in the form of higher prices across the board.And the main point of the article is a very good one: what happens to all the now-unskilled labour?

That way it wouldn't just be hyper inflationary. If you give everybody more money, nobody has more money. Capitalism is built on inequality."	aszantu	13.721595	6.932053	comment	4.0	24.0	1593206410	-15.906062

I could see the rent-seekers adjusting their charges accordingly. A slumlord could now price their rents on a poor person making $60k a year (40k + 20k from their job) instead of just on the $20k alone. Doubling or tripling the rent. Consumer goods would possibly follow the same pattern.Maybe UBI would come with some sort of rent or price controls. Or maybe the fear of massive inflation would temper the greed of the rent-seekers.

(The jobs would have to be unnecessary in order to be invented, because if they were necessary, they would already exist.)Both of these solutions are terrible, and I can't think of any others that are qualitatively different -- you either put people in existing jobs or create new jobs.The point of UBI, according to most of its proponents, is that it deals with a future of automation in which many people will not be able to find work.	twblalock	13.716147	6.927158	comment	4.0	12.0	1493932074	-15.893118

If that's the case, the money that's actively being used should increase.	CJKinni	13.720606	6.9317822	comment	4.0	16.0	1494619871	-15.897105

That's why these days I'm more a fan of a negative income tax coupled with a repeal of the minimum wage. Consider if the ""tax brackets"" were something like:    * 0   - $2k  : -1,000%
    * $2k - 4k   : -500%
    * $4k - 6k   : -100%
    * $6k - $8k  : 0%
    * $8k - $15k : 5%
    * ...
    * $10M+      : 40%

(Something like that, exact numbers to be fiddled with.)What it essentially does is it provides a government money multiplier on low wage jobs. A company could offer $1/hr jobs, which the employee would perceive as $10/hr. That is, $1/hr = $2k/yr = $20k, after taxes.

If (2) is true and we introduce UBI, then there will be more demand for the basic necessities of life (coming from all the people who were unable to afford them before), which will in itself result in inflation (which, btw, doesn't measure the total supply of money, but overweights the basic necessities of life and underweights e.g. the stock market). If you combine that with the decreased motivation of people to work (resulting in lower supply), the resulting inflation will be massive.	tomp	13.7174635	6.906618	comment	5.0	21.0	1485101664	-15.892311

What are we going to do if UBI actually increases it? Which actually has great chances of happening, because the money paid to poor will eventually be pumped into more wealthy pockets.

The advantage of the UBI is that you see more clearly what you're doing, so that if somebody suggests to e.g. have a steeper phase out, what it really corresponds to is having a higher marginal tax rate on lower income people than higher income people.

So there's going to be a lot less pressure on dual income households to work beyond their basic income. Logically, this would put double (or even triple) the additional pressure on single income households. Under UBI, they'd have to provide enough in taxes to provide the UBI for themselves AND dual income households.How do UBI proponents solve that problem?	notzorbo3	13.72134	6.9338784	comment	5.0	25.0	1512660249	-15.898749

However, it does suffer one deep flaw that I haven't seen anyone promoting UBI address.How do we ensure that UBI doesn't become weaponized against the people it's supposed to be helping?If UBI is passed it becomes the single most important issue to the majority of voters. Someone running on a platform of 'more money' will (even if it's economically a bad idea) likely win elections based on it. If there is an economic need to decrease the UBI payments it will be the death knell of political careers.But the biggest concern I have is this:We've alre	Proziam	13.719749	6.9307446	comment	7.0	27.0	1615488485	-15.896598

Specifically, the overall system they're a part of will respond differently.Take education, for example. It's pretty obvious that getting a college degree will help any one individual out - everyone applies for jobs, and employers will look favorably on those with a college degree. The calculus changes when you make it way easier for everyone to get a college degree, since employers can't prefer everyone.I have a similar worry about UBI and other anti-poverty interventions. If the system is set up to squeeze the poor until they are inches away from starving or rioting, then an extra $500/yr will help any individual stuck there out by quite a lot.

33157092	This is a very hard problem to solve	This is a very hard problem to solve. The issue is not just the money and wealth itself but the power to control its flow. You can arbitrarily distribute the money but there are so many gatekeepers deep inside of the societal structure who're going to squeeze as much as possible from the policy and they have enough power to do that. For instance, you give 1000 bucks to everyone? Then landlords will increase the rent by 800~900 bucks.While I still think that UBI can be quite a useful tool to solve poverty problems, this is not a silver bullet and has its own caveats. We still need to understand how those powers are working in practice and handle them one by one. Otherwise, this could be easily repurposed into a tool to reinforce the established power structure.	summerlight	13.716233	6.9252853	comment	7.0	72.0	1665440606	-15.897187

Wanting to not coerce people into working is not at all incompatible with my position. In theory, they both advocate greater choice.Unfortunately, in practice, people who are pro UBI are often taking a position that is highly likely to deny people choice rather than grant them greater choice.

If you limit the prize, then you also limit amount of effort that one is willing to make to get it.Therefore, after UBI is introduced on mass scale we might see a slow but steady decline in economic activity: fewer new companies started, fewer investments made, riches focusing on tax evasion and moving their business abroad instead of just running and developing it, resulting in recession.Of course you can go with nuclear option and forfeit all their properties at once, in the name of social justice (does that ring a bell?) but you can only do it once, and eventually will run out of the money seized this way.	mamon	13.723305	6.9347105	comment	9.0	42.0	1494620983	-15.898785

That's nearly 20% of America's GDP. How is it possible to pull this much money out of the American economy without crashing it?Scope. I am of the opinion that one of the beauties of federalism is that policies can be tested first at the state level before we commit our entire nation. Why would a national government do this?Necessity. I don't think we need to be paying anyone who makes over 50k (maybe not the right number, but there should be a cutoff). That just takes money away from those who need it.If a supporter of UBI can respond, I'd like to discuss possible concerns and benefits.	mises	13.718037	6.928195	comment	9.0	59.0	1549644426	-15.897798

Despite its problems, properly-functioning capitalism keeps the few accountable to the many. Billionaires can only throw their weight around up to a point, because at the end of the day they rely on regular people to keep their economic engine going. They need us for our economic value, which gives us power. If that became no longer the case, democracy itself could be abolished, with no consequence to those at the top. Capitalism has many problems, and doesn't work on its own, and certainly needs fixing in 2019, but I think it's also the lynchpin maintaining any status quo at all between elites and everyone else.Now, this also assumes that pe	_bxg1	13.713094	6.9190865	comment	9.0	39.0	1555861046	-15.895827

No more fraud because there is no need to: you always qualify, and as a result, no need to fight it.

For example, price increases and inflation might arise from everyone having extra money.If you’re only testing UBI on a small population, then 1) it’s not even universal, and 2) there will not be enough “beta testers” to (in)validate these criticisms.So while this may be a “success” (how do you even measure that?) it’s not a meaningful experiment at all.	chatmasta	13.711637	6.924497	comment	10.0	75.0	1510767537	-15.892683

In this manner, individuals are paid a basic income in exchange for their productivity. However, these jobs are not meant to create wealth. They're meant to provide subsistance. This is much the same goal of UBI.For those that say that benefits (health, retirement, sick pay, family leave, vacation) are necessary in addition to low wage income which often does not supply many or any of these benefits, I would say that is the case for UBI as well.For UBI to work, there must be a base of benefits 	rexreed	13.709965	6.915465	comment	11.0	41.0	1578845707	-15.887323

By the late 1970s the US was experiencing stagflation, a combination of low interest rates, high inflation, and high unemployment, which should have been impossible according to the Phillips curve.In reality the Phillips curve was too simple.

It's very plausible this would not show up in small scale pilots where only a small percent of a population received income, but would show up at scale when everyone does.Unless UBI comes with a massive overhaul of zoning restrictions and a shift of the housing supply, I don't see how this doesn't end up as an indirect way of increasing income inequality by routing the UBI from poorer tenants to wealthier landlords.	gavman	13.721212	6.933514	comment	12.0	49.0	1594386674	-15.900146

This was great because you could spread the payments out over more time, lowering your monthly payment.Oh wait, the 30-year mortgage is open to everyone.  So now everyone has more buying power.  Prices rise and you end up in the same spot as before - a big chunk of the population can't afford a house.Why wouldn't this happen with UBI?

Controlling everyone's income will attract the greatest power mongers the world has ever seen.Perhaps the unspoken honest answer is that people without other assets are going to live in 'poverty' (compared to the rich); their brains will operate at better watts-per-compute than the computers for a long time and still be worth something. They will earn a living on this. The people that do have assets (e.g. own the robots), are going to be extravagantly wealthy. It will be a feudalism but without violence, seniorage, or other expectation that the poor work for the good to the rich. Just that there's going to be really poor and really rich.I and my kids will almost certainly 	DickingAround	13.718433	6.9285455	comment	16.0	130.0	1487693575	-15.890428

I'm sure part of it is because I don't prefer interacting with humans but - as the owner of a machine learning consulting company - I see few jobs that can't be automated today with current technology given enough time.Most jobs are bullshit jobs. Employment today is increasingly a heavily biased and ethically corrupt way of implementing UBI.	barefoot	13.711234	6.919328	comment	16.0	112.0	1547067491	-15.890583

The fundamental issue I would like addressed is the macro scale inflation you would expect when redistributing trillions of dollars without commensurate economic value being created directly.Money is a complicated subject, but essentially it represents a transfer of a future scarce resource. For commodities, the cost is essentially the sum of labor to generate it (either to mine the raw resources, build the factory, etc).If no economic resource is being added to the economy, then you are just devaluing money. That is usually very regressive, and in this case could be m	chris_va	13.721205	6.9302115	comment	18.0	173.0	1494618326	-15.897396

Ever.I know -- it's a common feature of income support systems, including here in the US.I don't know whether UBI is going to prove workable or not.  But even if it doesn't, if we could just redesign the systems we do have so they never give recipients a disincentive to work more, that would be a huge, huge improvement.

Giving a few hundred people extra money each month will improve the well being, no question about it.The issues with UBI only arise when it's done at scale. For example let's say you give every US citizen over 18 a monthly UBI check for $1000. What's stopping prices from rising accordingly? How will the ~$3T yearly UBI bill be paid for?The question of how is this paid for is my biggest issue with UBI. If someone can give a reasonable answer that doesn't require national price fixing, taxing tech companies on their data, or some version of reshuffling the current budget around, I'll happily change my mind. Until then, for me, UBI is nothing more than an economists wet dream.	admin_account	13.720006	6.930475	comment	21.0	172.0	1591123377	-15.900619

People will receive UBI, but then other things, like rent, food, etc. will all just magically get more expensive.I cannot see any implementation of UBI working any better than things now unless the predatory nature of those in power is put in check.	bmitc	13.721085	6.9318776	comment	21.0	373.0	1596100521	-15.897556

He get’s paid $42k a year because they have to find people who would be willing to do this sucky job and need to pay higher than minimum wage to do so. At some point of income, people would be willing to accept the suckiness.
Now let’s throw UBI into the world. Everyone is getting $2k a month.  Now a garbage man says “I’m not gonna be a garbage man anymore, I can do something I love now, like a music teacher that pays $30k”.

It especially works when a very small subset of the population receives such treatment, such that their relative income is higher than those outside the experiment.The issue with UBI is that enacting it at scale has two huge problems:1. Financing it. These programs are monumentally expensive. You need to get the money from somewhere. The easiest place to take it is via the money printer and the second is from the rich.If you do it via the money printer, it's a self-own in terms of inflationary impact.If you do it by taxing the rich, you wind up hobbling and punishing your most productive citizens.
