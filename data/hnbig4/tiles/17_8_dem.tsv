Blockchain is a good solution when the nodes are not necessarily trusted (thus the need to prove that you did the work).  If all the nodes are trusted you can accomplish the whole decentralized thing much more easily.As a super simplified example, if you want your distributed database to generate unique identifiers, partition the id space so each node is guaranteed not to overlap.  You trust to nodes so you don’t need blockchain.	veleek	13.677121	1.1403702	comment	3.0	20.0	1664843977	-2.3377967

Oh, and C) it might’ve resolved the duping issues with cross-server character transfer exploits (a different beast than areaservs), and D) heh, maybe conned an engineer into making a block explorer dashboard so we could see the global state of currency/stackable amountsLike you said: most of these except B) could’ve been done with traditional tech	cottenio	13.595263	1.3154927	comment	3.0	17.0	1664844621	-2.1280684

When you give your crypto to Coinbase, there is no $250,000 FDIC insurance that comes along with it. You don't even get to know what wallet it's in, and if Coinbase decides to go sideways, they can snatch up your money with no legal consequence. You're right that part of the problem is the US failing to regulate them, but there's nothing to regulate. A public ledger does not a currency make.Your parents will never have a custodial wallet. The fact that traditional banking is easier than 'doing crypto right' should give you all the adoption metrics you need.	smoldesu	13.522191	1.5829566	comment	3.0	10.0	1665094019	-1.928811

The blockchain doesn't determine your dob, the person who enters it does, and now it can't be altered later and if it does there's a record of it.Blockchain is really just an ultra logging mechanism that's already setup where you would have to design that setup yourself in sql.

For example, just looking at brute network statistics, a 1MB blocksize causes a well connected node to use approx 1 Mbps of bandwidth. Therefore with zero improvements in the way the blockhain is implemented, we could scale to a 100MB blocksize, allowing 350-700 tps, and the bandwidth would only cost $50-100/month (cost of a 100 Mbps unmetered colocated host in the US). Disk usage would grow 5TB per year without pruning, maybe 2-3 TB with pruning, that's $50-70 per year in HDD.I don't know about you but I feel pretty good that without any algorithmic optimizations, Bitcoin seems to have a 100x scaling potential, with a full node still remaining a	mrb	13.73019	1.4028428	comment	3.0	14.0	1500709969	-6.1946807

Proponents of BCH can trade their BTC for BCH at a rate greater than they believe it is worth to easily pump the value and 'market cap' (most market cap stats have no measure of this 'locked supply') to make BCH appear more popular than it is at a fraction of the price that would be necessary if selling was easy. This could sway more miners to choose to mine BCH over BTC, and in doing so, actually increase the real value of BCH.From:

So why would rational organizations place $60b+ with Tether, when the risk is higher, and it's not like "	raesene9	13.952138	2.0456238	comment	3.0	44.0	1624021295	-14.851874

Bitcoin would still operate correctly with less mining capacity. What is sacrificed is that the threshold for mounting a 51% attack becomes lower with less miners. But again, the network itself does not need a nation-state's worth of electricity to operate.	v64	13.720911	1.9645555	comment	3.0	10.0	1584389286	-3.330543

I think it speaks to the strangeness of Bitcoin, and its niche idealogical underpinnings. Bitcoin solved a problem that most of the people never thought about. Yet if you're looking to solve Bitcoin's problem set, calibrated hashcash to secure a ledger seems completely obvious.I also thought that Bitcoin's asic-vulnerability (and thus mining centralization) would be fatal. It turned out to be not fatal (yet), but thats not something which could be determined on paper. It needed real-world use before people knew if it could work or not.	aakilfernandes	13.579369	1.6859614	comment	3.0	21.0	1504121601	-1.8033056

Because of this, it seems like it doesn't do much difference compared to just switching to PoS via a hard fork whenever it's ready.

This can support price growth for a long time, and first-mover advantage is critically important here.Second, Bitcoin development, as fraught as it is, isn't dead.

27336706	Sure, but a lot of early technologie	Sure, but a lot of early technologies move laterally in some unexpected direction, and it was reasonable to expect blockchain stuff to do the same. Maybe the original idea could never fly (even in 2008 you didn't have to be a genius to see that evading financial controls would be the chief use of a working cryptocurrency). But likely someone would find a really neat twist on it and find the blockchain equivalent of VisiCalc, and that would happen again and so on.What's interesting to me is that the original idea was clearly brilliant, but never found any of those lateral steps. It's kind of a string theory for programmers now.	idlewords	13.662453	1.334982	comment	3.0	47.0	1622408454	-2.1235251

That doesn't happen in real markets, and it seems to only happen in crypto when the exchange is using customer deposits as leverage (Celsius) or trading on their own account, which means against their customers (binance, probably ftx)	paulusthe	13.565495	1.9160907	comment	3.0	10.0	1667574298	-1.4107952

I don't think the base project with the typical token scheme is worth anything, but the way it uses disk space for mining is kind of neat.The general idea is that you precompute a bunch of proofs and store them on disk.  Challenges are issued and if you have a matching proof, you can claim the token for that challenge.The part that I find interesting isn't the tokens.  It's the concept that an algorithm can prove you've committed some disk space to the network.  The reason I find it interesting is because, for small amounts of disk space, the incremental cost of participation is $0.  If I plot proofs on unused disk space and only try to match proofs when my computer is on anyway, it basically costs me nothing.Compare that to someone trying to farm (aka mine) on an 	ryan29	13.796996	1.5189155	comment	3.0	11.0	1667615150	-3.102153

But that offer had to be withdrawn because things got so bad.Now everybody involved is worse off than they were before, a lot of customers might lose money, and there is a pretty good chance that regulators and governments are going to get more involved in the crypto market in response.If this was planned in advance, it was not 4D chess, it was just a really bad plan.	twblalock	13.661028	1.7767347	comment	3.0	12.0	1668041585	-14.122563

Once you sell your coins, your private keys are no longer worth anything, which means you could potentially even sell these keys to an attacker with no risk to yourself.The attacker of course does have value though, if someone can gather enough private keys together for a specific snapshot in time, they can create an alternate history.Another big issue with proof of stake is that once you have a certain amount of stake, through diligence you are always guaranteed to preserve that amount of stake.

And keep access to it in a paper wallet; control of those $10M lies in access to a private key, so if you keep the key secret, nobody can access them (like with Satoshi's $40B or so in Bitcoin).That people don't seem to want to do this is perhaps a lesson in human nature that crypto-anarchists and other aficionados of ""trustless completely-distributed systems"" should perhaps heed.

The more specific a currency's use case, the less processing power that will be dedicated to processing that currency's blockchain.

Decentralized systems should give more security, but what about a cryptocurrency like NEO?

This rambling, bizarre article boils down to a few very basic, extremely played out arguments.Argument 1: Proof of stake concentrates wealth more than proof of work.You can make that argument, but POS advocates have for a long time argued that proof of work mining has more economies of scale than proof of stake and therefore the opposite is actually true. Equating proof of work miners to the working class & stakers or developers as wealthy elites or rulers is so massively cringe it's tough to even read.Argument 2: Ethereum is in active development, is planning to switch to proof of stake, has things like difficulty bombs, and therefore is somehow dishonest.Decentralized blockchain communities come to consensus around 	ahdeanz	13.841515	1.5732996	comment	3.0	12.0	1628663983	-8.890342

Blockchain is a mathematical construct. If anyone says blockchain is a scam, he/she/they may as well say addition is a scam, so is subtraction.What IS scam, in my opinion, is the ability to exchange crypto currency for tangible and non abstract products that has a meaningful value in day to day life. Crypto is not backed by any real assets, hence my problem.	subhro	13.567587	1.3805801	comment	3.0	13.0	1628693990	-1.9525064

(Under quite some assumptions, namely that they could sell the commercial paper at the value at which they hold it in their accounts.)However, if the value of their assets would shrink, say, by 1%, their equity would be wiped out, and they'd not have enough dollars to satisfy their liabilities. Then, if people would start demanding their dollars, the last 1%-0.26% = 0.74% of tether holders would get nothing, because there'd be nothing left.That could trigger a good old bank run - you don't want to be among that last percent of bag holders, so better take out your dollars now while they still have some.

The whole point of Tether is to supply liquidity to the crypto market. So is it surprising firms specializing in it utilize an outsized share??The thing is tether is pegged. It’s not like if you buy a million dollars worth you’ll get rich. In fact that money is now tied up in an asset that doesn’t grow and will slowly shrink due to inflation.What would be much more problematic is tether being used by large criminal organizations to help shelter or launder money, but I haven’t yet seen evidence of that.	crazydoggers	13.972116	2.0489223	comment	3.0	31.0	1628784747	-14.860313

However there is a relatively complex dynamic between the miners/executors, the protocol developers, and the community. A blockchain protocol is a shared contract between them and the power to change that contract requires some kind of consensus between multiple parties. At one point, Bitcoin was using signals from miners to show adoption of a protocol change, which AFAICT amounted to a weighted vote, weighted by mining power. I would argue that makes the miners similar to a legislature, and makes the protocol similar to a legal system.

Running a VM in the cloud as a full node is not that cheap.  All of these problems scale linearly with increased block size.

If you want to have lots of full nodes running in the long run, you need to focus on those that do not do so for idealistic reasons, most notably the miners, payment processors, and exchanges. They all have advantages by doing so. Blockchain.info, for example, runs a full node to be able to display incoming transactions and to monitor the network. Adopting this view, the way forward is to grow Bitcoin as much as possible. The more users there are, the larger the ecosystem becomes and the more players there are that benefit from running a full node. We can't rely on the early enthusiasts.

The last couple of halvings appeared to have little effect on the global hashrate, and so had little effect on the energy consumption.The vast majority of Bitcoin mining is done by professionals. I doubt many people buy thousands of dollars worth of hardware to mine simply for fun. Miners are looking to profit.People will mine the coin up until the point at which it becomes unprofitable. The cost of mining is more or less the cost of electricity (you can amortise the cost of the mining hardware over time). It makes sense to mine when the value of a coin is higher than the cost of the power used in mining it. Electricity cost is proportional to energy consumption. Hence, Bitcoin's energy consumption is proportional to its value.	joosters	13.694828	1.9308125	comment	3.0	12.0	1470773558	-3.198848

It's a lot nicer, and there isn't really the same collapsing effect as can happen with Monero.That said, Monero crypto is simpler, doesn't have trusted setup, and overall I would advocate that people treat Zcash as hemorrhaging-edge experimental, while Monero is somewhere between cutting-edge and bleeding-edge."

39280282	The current bitcoin blocksize is lim	The current bitcoin blocksize is limited to 1mb.  This means, on average, only 1mb worth of transactions can be written to the ledger.  With that 1mb we save thousands of transactions.  When you pay a transaction fee you are essentially bidding on your data being written to the ledger every 10 minutes.  You are correct that the more people bidding, the higher we can expect the price to be.There is however no technical reason we should limit the blocksize to 1mb.  We could have 10mb or even 100mb blocksizes easily.  Realistically a 100mb block would be large enough to handle all transaction data our species currently generates.The transaction fee is a considerable portion of miner's revenue.  Miners ultimately are responsibility for making changes to the bitcoin protocol.  I think it's unli	gamepsys	13.649908	1.4204718	comment	3.0	23.0	1707252129	-1.968058

Money-printing drives inflation which is is a regressive tax that disproportionally hurts the poor, who don't own real estate or stocks. It accelerates the wealth gap, which further strains our society. Bitcoin is a means to expand financial inclusion, and help level the playing field just a bit.

Before that it was always impossible. You get a bunch of people all over the world, many of them are identified only by Internet handles. There's no investment to handle all the legalities of establishing a business, and anyway there's no legal framework for international businesses with psuedo-anonymous people.But with blockchain we've been using DAOs and online voting tools etc. since 3-4 years now, and it works great. It handles the governance and the finance in a way the traditional system cannot offer.	neiman	13.6207905	1.2506975	comment	3.0	49.0	1642231173	-2.121783

However, it does have a perverse incentive to miners to consume as much energy as possible.Each additional miner that comes online doesn’t really add anything of value to the network at this point. It just consumes more energy. Each miner plays a game of maximizing their own energy usage to maximize their take of the fixed rewards structure.It has to be the single most inefficient large-scale engineering project I can think of, and certainly the only one that literally pays people globally to make it less and less efficient.

This is being addressed by moving things to rollups, and later by expanding rollup capacity with shards. Some stuff is in production on rollups already, but everything's in flux because the tech is still improving at a rapid pace.Rollups take transaction capacity from a couple dozen transactions per second to a couple thousand, and sharding will multiply rollup capacity by a factor of twenty initially, and significantly more later as hardware improves.

Whereas synced bitcoin full nodes can forget all about spent outputs, Monero full nodes must keep some info about them, and be able to efficiently index this info.For its initial block download, a node must download and verify rangeproofs for all outputs, not just the unspent ones.Wallets must be able to sample decoys from a large fraction of all historical outputs.This makes Monero much more bloated than Bitcoin.A more detailed comparison between Monero and Bitcoin can be found at https://gist.github.com/phyro/ec37d8bfedd36102b0ea5824580d06...	tromp	13.537507	1.5152355	comment	3.0	14.0	1644099747	-1.8814737

Turing machines can do stuff and machines can talk to each other. Whether it's possible to build a technically equivalent thing is not really the important question.What tends to happen though is that the underlying infrastructure if supported by a profit-making company is that it has its own agenda and desire to control access.

It turns out it's 10 minutes, not 5 minutes as you would intuitively think. (it's a memoryless process, so average expected time till block is always the same - 10 minutes - no matter how many blocks were recently found).In other words, when you're waiting for bitcoin transaction to be confirmed and go to check how long ago the most recent block was produced, in order to estimate how soon the next one will come - you're doing it wrong.

These validators have coins bonded as collateral in exchange for more voting power in the consensus process.One key idea necessary for Proof-of-Stake is to punish Byzantine validators, i.e., those who deviate from the consensus protocol, by destroying their bonded stake. If you misbehave, then you lose some proportion of your collateral.

Nobody really cares about the ""truth"", they care what society says is acceptable (and what governments will enforce).

You can break the problem into transaction volume (how many transactions can be processed on average per sec) and transaction velocity (how fast a particular transaction can be approved).Transaction volume scalability results almost entirely from checking that the rules of the system have been followed i.e. that each block in the chain is valid. We now have very fast systems for recursively proving the validity of blockchains. For instance coda [0] requires very little space or computation (constant in the number of transactions) for a party to be convinced the blockchain is valid. Under such a system you could increase transaction volume by orders of magnitude.Layer two protoco	EthanHeilman	13.699291	1.3856521	comment	3.0	18.0	1532908162	-2.3337631

16151115	When energy becomes cheaper, miners 	When energy becomes cheaper, miners can do more mining, leading to an increase in blocks.  Given that people are only willing to pay so much for a transaction to complete, there is only so much demand at a certain price point.  Once the supply of blocks increases, you eventually have price points where the demand no longer matches the supply.  At this point a miner would lower their fee until the demand increases back to supply.Supply and demand drives prices, but it does so through individual actors setting prices they are willing to pay/accept (or by algorithms that have been setup by some human who set up the rules by which it will set prices).

But regardless we will find out soon as the number of nodes on the live system is very rapidly growing.3 doesn't really apply, as channels can be used as middle hops to rebalance.If I give money to you for a good/service and drain my channel. Then I buy more Bitcoin from coinbase, coinbase can route that BTC to me through you to rebalance our channel so it is all on my side.4 isn't true, as ""locking the BTC up"" is basically making it available.

Don't hold Zimbabwe dollars - problem solved!Traders want something like USDT for the utility it provides. I don't think most traders care about the backing of USDT or it's potential redeemability for USD. I think most people enjoy the utility of a token that is always ~1USD.

It's a simple rational decision: if you want bitcoins, they're cheaper to buy on an exchange.If your total operating operating costs (building rent, etc) are higher than your expected revenue, then you lose money due to paying down liabilities. You might try to trim long-term operating costs (laying off staff, move to smaller building, move to place with cheaper electricity), or you might try to exit (sell mining hardware).There's very little psychological drama in all this: the market for hashing power is very predictable, and it will adjust over time to provide narro	dantillberg	13.694915	1.9197723	comment	3.0	10.0	1517920578	-3.1025608

Unlike Bitcoin, this Help can never be converted for fiat and is only useful for receiving tutoring.Unlike Bitcoin, this wouldn't be decentralized though.

Your chances of successfully finding a small-enough hash are completely independent of everyone else. It's not some sort of race to find a block, and as soon as someone finds a block everyone has to start again. (Other than that they can't reuse the same transactions, and need to update the parent block pointer).If I give you £100 every time you find a random number that satisfies some property, the amount of £100s you get is independent of how many other people are making money with the same scheme.The only reason competition matters at all is because of the difficulty adjustment.	jstanley	13.6869135	1.7908088	comment	3.0	20.0	1655638909	-2.9539673

First, as Bitcoin becomes a more efficient payments system, users are better off. Their transactions settle more quickly and more cheaply (Zimmerman (2020)). Second, since fewer transactions need to be recorded on the blockchain, less memory and energy are needed to run a Bitcoin node. This saving lowers the cost of maintaining the blockchain, allowing more nodes to participate and making the system more secure against a double-spending attack (Budish (2018)). Third, by reducing fees, the LN reduces the incentive for Bitcoin miners to use large amounts of computing power, meaning less energy use and positive consequences for the environment.5 Fourth, less blockchain congestion may mean lower 	plankers	13.752327	1.3380667	comment	3.0	16.0	1657707290	-10.506983

Just because nobody has implemented it yet, doesn't mean it doesn't have a killer use case worth the cost of mining (which will decrease over a long period of time). Moving payments for API calls to Lightning becomes very efficient, given the (nearly instantaneous) transactions can occur off chain.I'm a big fan of mining with solar.

32560631	Immutable smart contracts on blockch	Immutable smart contracts on blockchains are available to anyone with the few dollars worth of ether or other base chain currency necessary to execute the contract on-chain. They do not cost anything to operate after being deployed. In that sense, Tornado Cash is a protocol, that has more in common with HTTPS than with a business operation. Smart contracts can be thought of as software-defined protocols. Given that HTTPS and other forms of encryption are used on the regular, for both good and nefarious purposes, I see no reasonable argument against mixers. There has to be a path for on-chain privacy. It is a human right. It's also a U.S. constitutionally protected 4th amendment human right.	chrisco255	14.072887	1.2898861	comment	3.0	11.0	1661230841	-14.35237

It has many other properties, like making the transactions public in most cases, and many other important things that are different from centralized databases and non public databases we have been using for the last 30 years.	wintom	13.660135	1.2944658	comment	3.0	17.0	1520525321	-2.1735325

If these rough calculations are correct, the global banking system uses ~100TWh/year (including datacentres, branches, heating in offices etc.) while Bitcoin is around one-third of that at ~30TWh/year for a negligible percentage of the total number of transactions, and a single Visa transaction (again factoring in datacentres etc.) is 41Wh per transaction whereas a single Bitcoin trasaction is around 20,000 more at ~826kWh. That was also 5 months ago, so the situation is likely to have got worse for Bitcoin, given the traditional banking system is incentivised to reduce energy consumption wherea	m-i-l	13.679867	1.9056561	comment	3.0	31.0	1554805806	-2.9815247

Over time mining is paid for by transaction fees in a competitive market.  If you get 2x the fees and the cost to mine stays the same, you get 2x as much mining.Granted that assumes transaction fees are ~1:1 with transaction count.  However, protection from a 51% attack eventually requires 1:1 increase in mining as the value of a 51% attack increase, so the lower bound is there.

It is also the focus of the very first email replies.

However, since COVID hit the issuance of stablecoin Tether has been through the roof, going from $4B to $18B and counting printed.Each Tether is supposed to represent $1 added to the crypto ecosystem.  So here's the big question: if there's not much retail interest this time, where did that $14B come from?  Or is it more likely that it didn't, and the Tether being used to buy BTC at ever-higher valuations isn't backed by anything?	howlgarnish	13.971871	2.051336	comment	3.0	15.0	1605859479	-14.85773

The media and people notice the price increase and jump into btc-usd because it's going up, narratives are created to justify why the price went up (paypal, fidelity, rich investor), btc-usd further increases, and now Tether (the company) sells its btc for dollars, so that they make a profit, and also to cover whomever else wants to redeem tether for usd, thus maintaining the illusion that tether is fully backed  by dollars.

Whereas currently it takes an equal mining cost to reap an equal reward, proof-of-stake rewards those who already have enough to stake. This is essentially a recreation of the inflation system we have in the fiat world, where printed money first goes to the government, who can spend it at its current value, eventually having it entropy out to other users through spending, at reduced purchasing power. This makes the rich richer, and increases inequality of savings in the network.So it's not exactly the same refrigerator, so to speak.	beaner	13.8583	1.5734577	comment	3.0	23.0	1606203090	-8.891981

Then you could demonstrate ownership by being able to predict the location or the momentum at any time based on that.But it would be fun to hold cryptocoins called HeisenbergsBut that is an actual physical particle."

That is an obscene amount. I argue this comes from the very high growth not being expected by the creators.Most of the miner rewards right now come from inflation (in spite of inflation being less than 2% per year). This was intended to allow the network to grow permissionlessly - so, anyone can sacrifice real-world resources for some tokens, and they don't have to buy from someone already owning it.The reason such a sacrifice is required is that you need a form of scarcity to prevent a Sybil attack[2].

This is a problem that can be solved with a SQLite database, it doesn't need a blockchain.I believe you're missing the opportunity that exists for automation. That database is heavily guarded by layers of human administration. I can't sell you my land without involving a bunch of humans who interpret contracts and push buttons. In a world where land ownership were recognized by tokens on a distributed ledger, buying and selling land no longer requires the overhead of all that administration.

Compared to others, it's still somewhat complicated.While the use of PoW for consensus is super simple (most cumulative difficulty wins), Bitcoin script is a huge source of complexity in itself, with tons of warts. As it turns out, you don't need script to do payments, multi-signatures, atomic swaps, discreet log contracts, bidirectional payment channels etc., i.e. nearly all of the functionality that script is used for.
All those can be done with so-called script-less scripts [1], which is mostly creative use of Schnorr signatures.Bitcoin's emission is not that simple either with the reward halvings every 4 years.

I don't think of them as ethical in the same way I'd think of an account at TDAmeritrade, Schwab, etc. Traditional brokerage houses have regulations forcing them to play fair, and reporting structures to enforce it.Crypto exchanges are trying to convince the world they are a more secure place for your coins. Better IT security and highly funded enough to probably make good on any hacks. The synergy is they want to keep me safe so they can keep their reputation (and their reputation gives them more business).Is that a fair deal? That's for each of us to decide.

Instead of exchanging one tether for another currency worth $1, it lent tether to entities that promised to pay $1 for each tether. If borrowers can’t pay back their loans, tether wouldn’t be able to trade all tethers in circulation for dollars.In May 2021, Tether had lent Celsius tether worth $1.8 billion, collateralized by $2.6 billion of Celsius’s crypto assets, the report said. Tether had to manage the risk of the loan as crypto prices fell. Eventually the loan was liquidated and Celsius suffered a loss. In addition to lending to Celsius, Tether received loans from the company that were twice its credit limit while owning 7.73% of its equity, the report said.Uh oh.

Being less complaint with US regulators is also the reason it is used more than any other stable (highest volume by a wide margin); because people without US bank accounts can actually use it.

So switching to electric heat can lower your carbon footprint, but might cost more.Cryptocurrency mining equipment is effectively an electric space heater that generates revenue.

Members of the DAO uses the site to do various actions, for instance buying tokens or making votes. The site sends the request to the wallet extension to be signed, and then it gets broadcasted to the ethereum network. At the end of the day, the wallets are still controlled by the user, it's just that hijacking the site allows them to fool a massive number of users that don't pay close attention.	gruez	13.559397	1.2499859	comment	3.0	14.0	1638886265	-2.131564

Bitcoin City would be paid for with the issuance of $1 billion in “volcano bonds,” starting in mid-2022. The 10-year volcano bonds would pay 6.5 percent annual interest. $500 million of the bond revenue would be used to buy bitcoins. The bitcoins would be locked up for five years, then sold to recover the $500 million purchase price; any profit on the sale would be paid out as an additional dividend. Holding $100,000 in volcano bonds for five years would qualify investors for Salvadoran citizenship.Seems legit.	CPLX	13.539014	1.9567279	comment	3.0	11.0	1639229990	15.190386

Even if tether wasn’t backed by dollars on a 1:1 basis, it would have a small impact on the current market cap of bitcoin. This is important because many people say tether is proof that bitcoin price is heavily manipulated and inflated. The reality is that selling $24 billion dollars worth of bitcoin won’t move that needle that much.2. I have no reason to not trust tether.

I'd argue that banking infrastructure is quite wasteful with their physical skyscrapers and vaults. Executives at banks would argue otherwise.Bitcoin aims to disrupt financial services to some extent. A significant electricity cost shouldn't be a surprise. Does that mean it should be outlawed?

The proof-of-work is completely independent of the number of transactions. A block could have 1 or 1000 transactions, but the energy consumption would be the same.People have this wrong idea that more transactions imply more energy consumption. That's just not true.	mrb	13.721357	1.9105417	comment	3.0	17.0	1612983044	-3.2188394

26093366	That's not how Bitcoin mining works.	That's not how Bitcoin mining works.A certain amount of bitcoin -- the amount determined by a schedule that was defined before the network became operational -- is given as a mining reward every 10 minutes. The incentives of the individual miners is such that the expenses of the miners (collectively) equals the mining reward -- and the major mining expense is electricity.If the mining reward is cut in half, the electricity consumption of the network is cut in half, too.In contrast, if the rate of transactions changes or the number of miners change, electricity consumption stays the same. (More precisely, the expenses of running the network equals the mining reward plus any transaction fees, and since the blocks are of fixed size, for more transactions to compete for space in the blocks inc	hollerith	13.700617	1.905149	comment	3.0	11.0	1612984011	-3.268969

Does putting this much money in Bitcoin have a positive economic impact? Does it have any tangible value other than as a stopover for hedge fund and organized crime money?I think not, despite all the chaff crypto-fanatics throw at you when you question their ideology.

This sort of initially unbacked issuance may be a crime in and of itself, but its possible Tether holders would have a legitimate claim on any assets if Tether fails or is shutdown and wouldnt take a loss (though it could take years to get back their money).Worst case scenario: its entirely, or almost entirely fraudulent, and Tether insiders have embezzled and spent as much of Tethers available hard currency as they can.	ac29	13.982901	2.0577393	comment	3.0	14.0	1613629130	-14.860322

The benefits of Bitcoin can truly be appreciated or judged once the tech has been adopted in a relatively larger segment.Even so, let's say Bitcoin is extremely inefficient and should just be abandoned as a failure (I'm of the opposite view though obviously), what's happening with Ethereum is far more interesting.

The platform supports, encourages, and enables this for users with only very introductory understanding of Cardano.Stake pools also suffer a penalty when they amass too much stake (their rewards decrease), so decentralization is encouraged and no one would be able to get, say, 50% RoA by owning of 50% of the Cardano currency (ADA)	pcthrowaway	13.891324	1.5545285	comment	3.0	12.0	1615322614	-8.942883

It's also a lever to turn government, social, financial and other systems into software.All that to say, yes, PoW and PoS are not necessarily tied to blockchains or DLTs.You can use PoW as a sort of captcha, for example. If it costs a little bit of CPU to submit a request to a website it's not a big deal for a human.

However I do think the whole ecosystem is flooded with 'morons' who believe its just the solution to everything. Usually people who don't know what they're talking about and only thinking of the money side of it.There is value in almost every new technology, I think blockchain and co haven't gotten a bad rap thanks to the 'morons' who are basically just 'pumping and dumping' or 'hyping' to make quick money. Which IMO is a shame because it stops the real innovation taking place.It could be something, but it's been given (rightly so) a stigma thanks to the cult of 'crypto bros'. So far a waste of potential.	bilekas	13.63007	1.3447412	comment	3.0	14.0	1651173560	-2.1283433

Needless to say that wouldn't happen because you are the owner of the stock, not Schwab.FDIC insurance covers a totally different scenario where the money you deposit doesn't really exist (lent to someone else in the meantime).What makes sense is that Coinbase isn't the owner of customers' crypto assets.

31391126	> mathematically guaranteed to be a 	> mathematically guaranteed to be a crypto dead-endYour argument is not mathematical at all. It assumes first that bitcoin needs to appreciate 10-100 times current value. And second, that political willpower exists to then shut it down purely because of energy usage. Neither of those conditions are mathematically guaranteed, nor are they even in the realm of mathematics. I won't even address the underlying assumption that energy usage is unilaterally bad.One possible outcome, for example, is that bitcoin just hovers around its current price for a long time. If feels like every discussion on bitcoin is made of people who either think that it must either take over the world or must go to zero.	datadata	13.555628	1.8551956	comment	3.0	19.0	1652648788	-2.36923

I get this kind of response all the time, and it's frustrating for one simple reason: miners certainly DO NOT CARE where their reward comes from: block rewards, transaction fees, whatever.At the end of the day, it's a very simple calculation for them: electricity costs in, Bitcoin value out. No matter where their Bitcoin reward comes from, they will not (for long anyway) spend more on BTC then they are rewarded.> If the market cap of bitcoin stays the same, then the mining reward in terms of energy will decrease.NO! The simple rules of arbitrage would ensure that more miners would be incentivized to beef up their electricity spend to mind faster to win the reward (again, block rewards or transaction fees, doesn't matter).	hn_throwaway_99	13.686185	1.907612	comment	3.0	13.0	1652649178	-3.170706

If it goes up, so will the investment in electricity.No.You're conflating two different things here: A reward-dominated bitcoin and a fee-dominated bitcoin.The reward takes money from bitcoin owners in the form of inflation. It decreases the market cap by increasing supply.The fees take money directly from bitcoin users.In the reward-dominated case, miners are funded by new demand for bitcoin, which props the market cap up.

Banning mining from using more than 1% of the grid energy in their location would make sense. Better might be to require mining to shutdown during peak energy usage. At peak energy becomes the scarcest and fixed rate users may be subsidized. It is also usually the dirtiest at peak due to peaker plants coming online.Edit: others are saying this bill ends miners from operating non renewable power plants- that also makes sense."	gregwebs	13.699259	1.9915689	comment	3.0	16.0	1654250991	-3.5689573

A competing force pushing miners away from including transactions that can be trivially fixed is just a bug.Imagine a mining ""optimization"" which involved miners making only empty blocks.

Using bitcoin does not grant that power to anyone, and therefore could be argued as a better base for a global currency.Namespace stuff is exciting for the same reason.

It just has to avoid taxes, avoid governments, and avoid sequestration.You can't take a tether and redeem it for a dollar, so it doesn't really even have a price. Tether is just a placeholder for a dollar in the crypto-world.Furthermore, Bitcoins aren't really priced in United States Dollars anymore, they are priced in Tether Dollars. The price reported on CNBC is tether dollars.It's so synthetic, even that chart doesn't really matter.  So, where can we find real dollars being exchanged for Bitcoin? We can find that in the GBTC trust. I would argue the actual price of a Tether is equal to the GBTC discount, which currently sits at 37%. So, a tether dollar is actually about 0.62 dollars.	winslett	13.9673605	2.0509422	comment	4.0	24.0	1668084494	-14.859182

AFAIK it is also used in certificate transparancy logs:  Every block of log entries contains a cryptographic hash to a previous block, so you can't rewrite log entries, only append them.  This is what guarantees honesty in the certificate world, and  is  I assume the only aspect you need for your proposal.But the Proof of work is basically a race to do as much computation as possible.  This is the part that wastes so much energy and resources, the part that slows things down, but also the part that provides value to cryptocoins by proving that someone wanted to waste/spend the resources.Do you see value in a system that has both aspects?	hyperman1	13.612732	1.3770354	comment	4.0	12.0	1671485310	-2.0999095

Using VISA requires a working settlement layer (because VISA transactions are reversable), banks, bank employees, bank buildings, international transfer support, international settlement layer, people handling those settlements, regulation, regulation enforcement etc. If you include all that then the energy usage of Bitcoin doesn't look all that bad.	mszcz	13.696336	1.8841431	comment	4.0	39.0	1616067167	-3.0394044

They were a problem before cryptocurrencies, and would continue to be a problem even if cryptocurrencies didn't exist.I think you'll find that many cryptocurrency fans are also green-energy fans, and would love to live in a world where all energy was 100% renewable.

Every joule of energy that goes into proof of work is a joule wasted by design. There is no free lunch.I’m starting to think that maybe cryptocurrency is the great filter. It’s actually pretty terrifying.Edit: we should probably have termed it proof of valueless work to make that clear.

In the case of ETH2, if your staking node goes down, you get slashed and lose some ETH. If there isn't slashing (not all PoS coins have that), I don't see what guarantee of network security or uptime there is.I'd be curious what PoS coin experts think about this part.

For context, I'm the organizer of the Silicon Valley Ethereum meetup[1] and am hopeful that blockchains and related distributed technology will have a big impact on society.  Many compare the rise of blockchain tech to the rise of the Internet; I think blockchain tech is in the protocol development stage (1970s, maybe 80s), and that it will take 5 to 25 years for the tech to evolve to the point that average person will use it (90s and 2000's).For context, in the cryptocurrency world, often the word maximalist is used to refer to hardcore tech evangelicals; so there are bitcoin maximalists and blockchain maximalists.

The current specs and docs are pretty daunting last I checked; hopefully that can be improved in time.Edit:I found this article to be a good introduction to the idea of PoH.

So let’s say someone sold a pizza for bitcoin a decade ago and it just so happens that bitcoin was obtained through unlawful conduct. Now the pizza seller might have technically, arguably, “laundered” the funds but as long as the pizza seller didn’t know the bitcoin was from criminal activity the pizza seller didn’t commit the crime of money laundering. They lacked the requisite criminal intent.This knowledge element is why the FBI’s email to Tornado is critical to the case.

So I have two issues with it. 1) I don't buy that the original problem it sought to solve, which I believe is currency related, but let's say it's trust in a distributed system where trust does not exist. I don't believe that is an actual problem that should be solved with a general solution like blockchain. 2) the solution doesn't scale well and is overly complex. It is overkill. I think that much simpler solutions would be sufficient and should be purpose built. I also wish it would die soon.	optimuspaul	13.670107	1.2672852	comment	4.0	12.0	1549484178	-2.1062188

It's not a silver bullet, but it can add trust. This article seems to miss that creating immutable records of intermediary attestations can serve as an audit trail later.

In reality, a reasonable (2-4×) increase wouldn't. The amortized cost of running a full node able to support 2-4 times larger blocks is only $5 per month (http://blog.zorinaq.com/full-node-on-5-dollars/). The block propagation delay has also largely been solved with Compact Blocks which transmit a nominal 1MB block in ~20kB. Also, at least 2 on-chain scaling technologies are being developed that would easily let us increase block sizes: UTXO commitment sets can reduce long-term blockchain storage by 50×, and Graphene reduces the size of a 1MB broadcasted block by another order of magnitude, down to ~2kB."	mrb	13.760309	1.4030268	comment	4.0	42.0	1511478977	-9.170525

There were many developers quite interested in larger block size for many years, since before the February 2016 ""Bitcoin Roundtable"" in Hong Kong. Segwit2x had over 90% of the hashpower of the bitcoin world voting for it, at one point a couple months before it was to activate. Hashpower is heavily tilted towards large mining pools, many of them in China, but it is still the best measure of consensus and support the network has. That's a major tenet of Bitcoin in the first place. (Though I wouldn't say ""only miners matter"" nor ""only users matter"", the network really needs both to work.)I think that the survival and modest success of Bitcoin Cash eroded the initial overwhelming support for Segwit2X.

Did you perhaps actually just convert Coinbase value to Hungarian Forints without really involving any Bitcoin transactions?I'm not really trying to be snarky.

What the usage of blockchain would allow is a chain of liability to exist among different companies in the supply chain. If you are signing off on a product, you are verifying the authenticity of the item, and if it arrives defective at the next location you assume liability. As a customer, what you would really leverage, is the incentive of every individual company to not be liable for any issues to the next company in the supply chain. You would still be required to some degree to verify the direct transaction of the item to yourself, but if ubiquitously applied, it should offer some higher level of trust simply due to the transparency offered.If this is needed in current society or will be implemented is another questio	lmpostor	13.606654	1.1845621	comment	4.0	16.0	1537972545	-2.1972175

The average voter hasn’t yet invested their life savings into Bitcoin, and once PoS systems exist at scale proponents can’t use the innovation argument anymore.

This means new capacity from these sources are likely to be built out increasingly in the future, and development would be accelerated by proper pricing of fossil fuels.

That would take some investment on your end as you would have to run pool infrastructure at a loss. But if you are a nation state, it's not a huge investment. You don't need to have any mining hardware of your own if you offer miners better returns for the use of their hardware than the other pools do.Once your pools, taken together, have a dominant share of miners, I would think you could run a 51% attack without ever acquiring a single ASIC.

When you “have” a Bitcoin, that means you have the private key to a wallet which the blockchain says has such-and-such amount in it. You can have that even if the miners all disappear. You can still use it to sign transactions, although they won’t get confirmed. You can even confirm them by mining a new block yourself with your transactions in it. (If all the miners are gone, the difficulty has hopefully dropped precipitously. And if not, you could always fork it to have a lower difficulty, since the only thing that stops forks currently is network consensus.)This doesn’t sound super useful, but it sounds about as useful as a bar of gold in a world where nobody considers gold to be valuable.	mikeash	13.591255	1.7364242	comment	4.0	16.0	1516738587	-2.2868583

Consider all coins using the same function to be the same family and the one with the most work and power to be the most valid. So there are sha256 coins, scrypt coins, equihash coins, etc. In the case of sha256 the most immune to attack is bitcoin. Everything else is massively vulnerable. In the case of scrypt, it’s litecoin. Everything else you should not hold because it can be swamped by the hashing power mining litecoin atm. So on.This is a little different from how people have been told to think about it before which is just focusing on the blockchain itself rather than the mining power behind any given variation/fork/whatever of block chain.Ps.

The security model of Bitcoin comes from proof of work, which most people complain as being waste. But it's not actually waste. It's secure because miners have to keep working hard and ""wasting energy"" because the network is worth protecting (and only if the network is worth protecting). With proof of stake, the stakers only need to make an investment once in the beginning, so it results in rich get richer, and the network is essentially ""protected"" by those who do not keep working hard to protect the ledger. This suffers from the same flaw that exists in the real world financial system. The whole system could collapse overnight like a domino if something goes wrong.

It has become a store of value only. The only possible solution that could change that is the Lightning network or other Layer 2 protocols.There are plenty of other coins however that are doing super exciting innovation. Bitcoin Cash and Nano are some examples. They're actually solving problems and moving the technology forward. And they're being adopted as payment methods as a result.It makes me incredibly sad to see how many people (especially on HN) have no idea about that, and have adopted an anti-crypto stance like it's some ideological war, constantly citing the same old tired arguments.	heidar	13.54724	1.4996645	comment	4.0	16.0	1613086414	-2.011776

26142748	Bitcoin critics continue to assert t	"Bitcoin critics continue to assert that mining is wasteful and disproportionately damaging to the environment.Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining is a net positive for the environment.Here's why:
First, proof-of-work mining is critical to Bitcoin. In the Bitcoin network, trustworthiness is protected by computation, and mining is what gives Bitcoin its ability to coordinate trust and facilitate the transfer of value without relying on a centralized authority.
The costliness to produce bitcoin is fundamental to its value.Unlike the US dollar, Bitcoin cannot be printed with the stroke of a keyboard.Instead, it converts the output from cheap stranded energy sources into something with monetary value.
Even so, Bitcoin’s energy consumption is trivial compared "	ycombinatorrio	13.68701	1.924021	comment	4.0	12.0	1613397297	-3.0256793

In that kind of monoculture, it’s easy to think that politics can and should be part of work life. In a much more diverse workforce, though, it rarely works well.If Coinbase is going to be remote-first, as they recently announced, the company’s employees are certainly going to encounter a level of diversity they haven’t been exposed to in the Bay Area.

Infrastructure folks' reward was going down ridiculously even with POW, the POS seems like way worse, and if the number of attestations goes wild, I am sure ETH folks will find ways to penalize infrastructure folks again.

With UTXO set hashes included in blocks, ancient blockchain history can be discarded on a rolling basis, turning the infinitely large blockchain into a fixed size rolling chain.This doesn't solve the whole problem as the UTXO set itself also grows, but I suspect appropriate incentives could manage this problem (fees for increasing UTXO set size and/or bounties for reducing it).With these problems solved, Bitcoin would theoretically be able to operate indefinitely without issue.

That barely exists in real life.Centralized systems are what you want in 99% of cases.

Adoption isn't happening faster not because it's unneeded, but because of inertia among wallet developers. Consequently, full blocks and high fees have caused Bitcoin to lose many users to alts (LTC, ETH, ETC, DASH...) All this user loss and tx market loss has been happening over the last year, so we urgently need a block size increase, since we can't magically accelerate segwit's adoption rate.I think you fail to envision how the dynamics will play out if Segwit2x wins.

BTC can currently process 7 tx/second with 1mb blocks.  If you double the block size, you get to 14 tx/s, it scales linearly.  PayPal processes ~150 tx/s, Visa processes ~5000 tx/s, and can burst up to 50k tx/s.  This is orders of magnitude off, and would require scaling blocks up to 1GB.  By setting the precedent that increasing blocksize is the answer to slow transactions, you open the door to a future where only a very limited number of powerful entities can afford to run a full node, which brings you right back to a centralized currency.  In order to scale BTC, it basically needs to move to off-chain transactions or some other new tech.  Th	keypusher	13.697797	1.3436702	comment	4.0	19.0	1510498676	-2.0545516

However, Tether can't be totally ignored because as of right now, it's still the best tool for some things.The main value of Tether is that the BTC-Tether market is the most liquid cryptocurrency market. So if you want to exchange Bitcoin into dollars in an all-cryptocurrency transaction, you will probably get the best rates into Tether, and be able to perform your transaction the fastest. If you plan on swapping out of Tether soon, then the systemic risk of Tether collapsing might only be a small problem for your application.It's a shame that the most popular stablecoin is such junk behind the scenes.

Maybe some limitation that's not reflected in the price charts?Edit: I see that this is not actually about Tether's liquidity at all.

So they can reach quorum on their own if they want to push something through unilaterally.Then you go and look at the history, and it's totally opaque who actually has the governance tokens- Apparently it was split 60% for community, 15% for investors, 25% for the engineering team.

Economies of scale determine the shape and growth of the curve while barriers of entry determine the cut with the y-axis. Obviously, the greater the barriers of entry or the higher the reward as your economic scale grows the bigger the push towards centralization. In the first case because you forbid small actors to participate in the game, in the second case because you reward bigger actors more generously.So how does this graph look for Ethereum?

In my mind, this is somewhat akin to creating a new currency, and then when a major bank trading in/holding that currency gets robbed due to lax security, the bankers decide that everyone needs to round all the currency up and rewind time and pretend like that never happened as a solution. Who's to say that won't happen again? I know that the DAO is instrumental to the early success of Ethereum, but what if some other major third-party is attacked in a similar way in the future?

You can't have it both ways. Interestingly, the cheapest power is where supply completely dwarfs demand.

Given the liquidity of modern capital markets, it's very rare for the fed to have to bail out small deposit banks. So it's reasonable to assume the same will apply to tether.

This has to be him just saying things the media wants to hear, because that simply doesn't work.The pollution generated by bitcoin is not a factor of mining efficiency, its a factor of its price.When bitcoin reaches $100,000, its pollution will be roughly equivalent to the pollution created from making $100,000 worth of energy.  Obviously this is a rough estimation, but its pretty close.  As a miner, if it only costs $80,000 in energy to produce one bitcoin, and you can sell it for $100,000, then you're gonna crank up the heat until you're closer to breaking even. So when 1 bitcoin reaches $1,000,000 it will take roughly $1,000,000 worth of energy to mine, and thereby create the pollution equivalent 	RedBeetDeadpool	13.70803	1.9692379	comment	4.0	39.0	1634438219	-3.1745083

Because those touted energy efficient protocols come at the cost of much weaker security guarantees which undermine a key point of Bitcoin.Proof of stake, the forerunner of energy efficient protocols, may work better for networks that have different aims, although smart contract oriented blockchains still need good security to be trusted.The stupendous levels of complexity involved in trying to hammer out proof of stake into a viable method of energy efficient mining make the approach look ever more unpromising.Ethereum keeps delaying the switch and the touted 2022 migration has once again been kicked into the long grass after this paper from a few weeks ago:

  - has the most number of farmers/validators of any blockchain
  - supports around ~25 transactions per second (as opposed to bitcoin's 5)
  - very efficient and auditable on-chain language (much better than Solidity afaict)

In the author's example of gathering funds to renovate a neighbourhood park, you'd still need to trust that the contract developers hadn't made a unfixable bug or deliberate backdoor, you'd still have to trust your neighbours to not screw up when interacting with the smart contract, you'd still need to trust the blockchain platform because if your funds are lost or stolen transactions are by design irreversable and you have no recourse to the law, etc. In pretty much every case, you would be better off without the additional complexity, risks and points of failure of a blockchain solution.What this is really about is t	astoor	13.594266	1.2587044	comment	4.0	16.0	1639130267	-1.9975939

Which surprisingly attracts a fair amount of defenders for the Snapchat et-als.What we can do is to be neutral to how it’s used, and instead make sure that electricity is appropriately priced to cover its externalities. That means a carbon tax. The same solution is still the right one for Bitcoin  as it is for other silly computer uses mentioned in this article.

Yet, just reading the first two samples, I already disagree with them.Re the 1st one: it's true only if the transporter doesn't risk anything if the sensor is tampered with. As soon as you introduce strong fines and/or consequences if a validating authority randomly checks your goods and discover some tampering, the system is a bit more likely to be trusted. But of course, in such a case, you might as well just host the temperature log with the validating authority (like it's done for Concrete, or in the Auto industry).The second one is even more compelling: of course the trust chain stops when the trust chains stops !

That isn't a brave or impressive thing to say, it is a common and misinformed perspective.Regarding Bitcoin, it's important to recognize that it's fundamentally about decentralization of financial control, not necessarily decentralizing value hoarding (though it largely does that too). It uses a distributed ledger technology, where the minting process (mining) and transfers (transactions) are verified by a consensus mechanism across a global network. This eliminates the need for central banking authorities, theoretically reducing the points of failure and censorship. It's designed to be a deflationary currency to counteract inflationary fiat systems, with a predictable supply that's governed by math, not by policy changes.

It's true that BTC mining is capital intensive, yet it is highly competitive and risky, and most miners get a decent profit, yet need to sell the vast majority of mined coins to run their operation. Miners can never move on some parabolic increase of wealth as the very protocol itself prevents this.Rather, we should look at holders. Bitcoin is fair in the sense that it does not have rich get richer built in.If I'm rich and own 1,000 BTC whilst some poor slum has 0.001 BTC, neither of us has an advantage within the protocol.

So, a couple hundred shards, each with 1000 users seems like a limit. But I wonder: 10 years from now, if the blockchain (maybe pipe?) dreams succeed, then why do we expect 1000 * 500 = 5M nodes?

From what I can tell, the main reason for the resistance to Segwit is that it reduces the power and influence of miners. That's why the people who are pushing BCH are also invested in mining. Miners earn money from transaction fees, and therefore have an incentive to artificially inflate the fees by delaying transactions (transactions are processed in order of highest to lowest fees).There's a great blog post which summarizes the situation here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-heck-bitcoin-might-split-...	brndnmtthws	13.671234	1.6039875	comment	5.0	45.0	1501616060	-9.024196

Almost anything written by Matt Levine is worth reading.This is a concise and accurate description of the fun that occurred with Bitfinex's handling of the BCH fork.At least, it's fun if you weren't involved. If you naively held BTC on Bitfinex and were hoping to receive an equal amount of BCH you probably didn't think it was fun. If you carefully read Bitfinex's statements and decided to take advantage of their policy to acquire risk-free BCH, you probably think it's even less fun.

That was the motivation for the project.- Contrary to the title of the article, making hashing faster for less energy doesn't ""help with the high energy consumption of the crypto currency mining activities"" once the technology becomes available to enough miners.It's the same as the introduction of ASICs before it: only a temporary advantage to those few who have it first.

In China, where more than two-thirds of the world’s crypto mining took place over the past decade, electricity rates are set by the government and inflexible to demand.

If the end result is that cryptocurrency discourse is effectively run out of HN, similar to phrenology or eugenics, that would delight me.	camgunz	13.539212	1.448404	comment	5.0	78.0	1638718686	-2.0993035

It always amounts to maybes and what-ifs. Usually, cooperating enterprises have a mutual trust in each other, or they wouldn't have entered into the partnership in the first place. A requirement for both trustlessness and anonymity doesn't make much sense in this context.As far as I can see, blockchains only really make sense if they're protected by some sort of proof-of-work, in which case old data becomes increasingly difficult to alter as more blocks are added to the chain.

Most of the articles and discussions gloss over the details.It is possible that this is part of the reason some miners are blocking SegWit but there is more to it.  Core (the main Bitcoin development team) promised to provide a block size scaling solution and then reneged.  This pissed a lot of people off and led to the blocking of SegWit.

Note that I was heavily involved in the Bitcoin community a few years ago, but have been on the side lines recently.  As with all things political, take my interpretations with a grain of salt:1) The Bitcoin network began experiencing congestion due to rise in popularity driving large numbers of transactions.  This resulted in slower transaction verification and higher transaction fees.2) Users started asking for larger blocks, so that the network would have higher transaction bandwidth.  The defacto Bitcoin developers at the time pushed back.  Increasing block size is simple in terms of code change, but requires a risky hard fork.  It's also only a temporary fix.

The value of a blockchain stems from the fact that, combined with proof-of-work, a single history of transactions can be agreed upon without a central party. This is the same feature that prevents alteration of history, because it would require recalculating the proof-of-work. This comes at a very high cost, however, since energy is literally burnt off just to reach this distributed consensus. Therefore, it only makes sense for the utmost valuable applications, like digital money.I mean, right now Bitcoin miners are paid over a million USD per day in order for the network to reach distributed consensus.

Much of the ""wealth"" of these coins is concentrated in the hands of early adopters.

In other words, they had at least $9B in liquid, USD-convertible assets they could use to redeem those tokens. USDT is currently trading slightly below its peg (around $0.999) and only dipped very temporarily to $0.98 as the cryptocurrency market was crashing.Now of course they still have $74B to account for and maybe I'm just naive but I have a little more faith in USDT now than I had a week ago, I still think that it's mostly backed by monopoly money but maybe not as much as I thought.	simias	13.73505	2.0069146	comment	5.0	15.0	1652883903	-14.838097

You're complaining that dollars are created out of nothing - they're not, of course, but even if they were: When Tether holds less than $1 of backing assets for each $1 of USDT in circulation it's worth strictly less than the $1 you're deriding. It is this gap we're talking about. So your comment isn't just wrong, it's completely irrelevant and a distraction from a real problem.Dollars enter circulation when they're borrowed. They leave circulation when the loan is repaid. The value of a dollar is derived from the obligation to repay the debt that created that dollar, and the legal system which enforces these contracts.

I think many people don't realize just how incredibly stagnate and boring crypto is when it's not consuming every part of everyone's online identity.

Consuming less energy on a particular sector means people in that sector have more money to spend on other things and those other things also cost energy (ok maybe less).

Answering “what compromises can we make to achieve consensus,” even less so. All deliberation and conversation must happen offline, in “meatspace” amongst humans and operating outside mathematical principles.

The cost is the power to do a hard-disk seek every long once in a while, rather than to compute sha256 over and over again.It does incentivize a buildup of physical disk drives.  And if it becomes successful, it'll likely spur specialized datacenters and hardware (think specialized tape drives) to try to outcompete in space, so it might end up just as centralized as bitcoin mining.But the power costs will be much lower.There also is a proof-of-time component, that does computation, but it is designed to not be parallelizable, which means that throwing additional power at the problem doesn't help you as much.

The implementation obviously takes years to finetune and the scaling solution might not work as well as research predicted.All other coins are early stage tech and research too.People were enjoying the tech when it was less popular and seemed like magic, now when big numbers come into play it is obvious things where blown out of proportion way too early.	nlperguiy	13.62937	1.5113336	comment	5.0	39.0	1514332603	-2.0141597

This tutorial may not show that so as to demonstrate the power of the blockchain, but most people in the space are building only the components players want to not be controlled by a central entity into the blockchain. It works fine.2. The lack of digital scarcity is a real problem for artists. Blockchain art is a real solution.

However, with a useful PoW, this calculus changes. Now, the PoW is no longer ""wasted"" when the miner cheats and gets caught as the PoW is now useful for something besides mining.

They wait days or weeks to get verified.  And the exchanges and money changers want to provide the virtual currency to the hungry customers, but they cannot afford to hire enough people to process all the verification applications.Given this extreme bottleneck, I don't see the significance of news about how much easier it is for people to spend virtual currency.Ironically, Coinbase is one of the most complained about in terms of slow verifications.	blunte	13.56304	1.6470994	comment	5.0	22.0	1518711223	-1.8613725

Simple past examples are systems like OpenPGP that bind public keys to owners. Programmable blockchains allow generalized applications requiring decentralized trust. A good example of a use of blockchain outside of financial assets is in trust management of vehicular networks. In order for vehicles to communicate amongst each other, they need to trust that the messages they are receiving are authentic using a decentralized consensus mechanism and some sort of Bayesian Inference Model.So in short, it is an extension of the internet (trust layer) and it will change the world.

If a crypto currency can solve above points by cutting out the middle man and making transactions virtually free instead of paying 1.29% + 0.25c per transaction that would be huge.But that is a big if. Bitcoin fails at almost all of the above points. The only coin that comes close is Nano (I've got no investment in it). They solve fast, secure, scalable and cheap transactions, which I think are the main problems right now. Read their whitepaper, it is interesting.

The HKMA prints Hong Kong dollars. They both derive their value from the U.S. dollar. If the HKD goes to zero, one has as much as if Tether goes to zero. (This is tautology.)The Hong Kong dollar is backed by the Hong Kong government. Tether is backed by no government. Tether is probably lying about its reserves. Hong Kong could just as well convert everyone's HKD to renminbi overnight.Point is, there isn't something fundamentally currency-like about one versus the other other than state backing.

Obviously that's not going to happen, something will give and that something is likely to be Bitcoin's price.But even though the articles I've seen are pretty fluffy, they probably stem from an underlying issue that makes Bitcoin different from traditional, energy-heavy industry: The value produced is not directly connected to the energy expended in production.

Core dev, on their part, want to keep the closest possible to original design (any change can have dramatic consequences).In 2016, scalability issues started to become really serious, and miners asked to increase block size (that is, to allow to add more transactions in a single block, so that transactions wait for less time before being validated).

It's often described as a stablecoin but that's not correct because it doesn't have an inbuilt stabilisation mechanism unlike Maker's DAI for instance.The way it works is purely based on well known legal mechanisms that have no cryptoeconomic properties on its own. The issuer holds a USD balance at a bank, then commissions a receipt that proves their balance and issues an equal number of USDT. 1 USD = 1 USDT at issuance time and the trustworthiness of both the issuer, the auditor and banks involved.The token itself is used to facilitate trading and many investors 'park' their gains in USDT while waiting for	decentralised	13.557238	1.9893956	comment	6.0	43.0	1539619253	-1.2400331

The insane gulf between the promises made by the “every day brings a new breakthrough” crowd and the reality of ICO’s and Bitcoin is vast, and hard to ignore. Blockchain is a neat idea, but presently it is used in ways that are far from compelling, and I’m yet to hear of a non-hypothetical application that could change that (apart from buying drugs, or money laundering).It’s also hard to forget the last few years of relentless evangelism, which was equal parts annoying and ethically challenged.	gotocake	13.559498	1.4174693	comment	6.0	47.0	1540783555	-2.0875487

It’d be like passing a bill banning electric vehicles but not gasoline, or shutting down solar plants but not coal plants.	dcolkitt	13.63954	1.7873234	comment	6.0	33.0	1628337893	-2.5924413

That will, most of the time, be fine. Commercial paper is exceedingly liquid.But sometimes, the liquidation will prompt a price fall. This is a fire sale. That, in turn, prompts more redemption, as holders of Tether grow concerned about its stability. This is a bank run. If Tether has a safety buffer between the value of its assets (U.S. dollar money market securities) and its liabilities (Tethers), this will--most of the time--be fine. If the situation spirals, however, a bank run can lead to collapse.	JumpCrisscross	13.97455	2.0554054	comment	6.0	21.0	1628695146	-14.8623295

What this means in practice is that no rational coin-owner is going to sell you coins at a fast enough rate that you'll be able to increase your means of coin production.  Put another way, the price you'd pay for the increased means of coin production will meet or exceed the total expected revenue created by staking those coins over their lifetime.  So unless you know something the seller doesn't, you won't be able to profit by buying your way into staking.Overall, this mak	jude-	13.898217	1.5849324	comment	6.0	35.0	1618423092	-8.846867

While it's true that proof space is less energy intensive to ""farm"", wouldn't economics dictate that the resource consumption is equal to proof of work's resource consumption? All you're doing is shifting opex (electricity consumption) to capex (hardware costs). We can see this in bitcoin mining hardware. They've gotten exponentially more efficient over the years, but electricity consumption hasn't gone down.

This is what makes it so hard to make any changes to Bitcoin, and forms the stability that many feel is one of its key strengths.	yourabstraction	13.810176	1.3103545	comment	6.0	39.0	1620242097	-8.848036

The scale of the scam is huge and regulators completely miss it.The day regulators finally ban tether (because printing dollars should be illegal), you're going to see Bitcoin crash spectacularly.

Currently it's about 10x Google's electricity usage.Total revenue is proportional to the block reward (an algorithmic parameter) and Bitcoin price. So to fix this, either they could reduce the block reward ahead of schedule (won't happen) or  something could happen to crash Bitcoin's price.

Individuals and small projects can’t develop experimental dapps on L1 because the gas fees are too high, but if they use an L2 then they only access a small portion of the userbase. Contrast this with development on BSC where there’s enough L1 scaling to make experimentation not excessive expensive, but L2 solutions are still available for large projects that need it and have the developer  resources to make cross chain dapps painless for users.It’s kind of funny because btc had the same issue, where scaling the base proto	injeolmi_love	13.672024	1.3772247	comment	6.0	30.0	1696081403	-8.581166

I'm not keen on forced blocksize caps as I don't see how that kind of planned economy model is compatible with the free-market money ideas behind Bitcoin, but even an unlimited blocksize would be unlikely to truly solve scaling.Bitcoin simply doesn't scale very well because of the way transaction history need sto be stored. As long as the rate of blockchain growth can't be significantly reduced, transaction rate can't grow very much.So small block proponents are likely to be right in that on-chain scaling is unrealistic, but if the market must be forced by developers to adhere to an artificial limit, I think that in itself implies Bitcoin is unlikely to be able to grow very far as the market is unable to self-regula	rebuilder	13.729107	1.4457432	comment	6.0	48.0	1500708342	-9.147432

15467670	Bitcoin faces serious barriers in sc	Bitcoin faces serious barriers in scaling to high volumes. As you say, transactions are limited to ~10/s. A side effect of this is that transaction fees are now $2 per transaction (and rising). Furthermore, the blockchain has now exceeded 100 GB in size. At high volumes, this will approach the petabyte scale. Only data centers will be able to store the blockchain, and power will be concentrated in the few players able to build/rent blockchain data centers.However, these barriers do not mean Bitcoin is doomed to fail. Logically, there are two paths to success: (1) Bitcoin is rearchitected to handle high volumes or (2) Bitcoin succeeds in low-volume applications.	tedsanders	13.641454	1.4190853	comment	6.0	21.0	1507916104	-2.1405718

This makes it pretty much impossible for a normal person to contribute to PoW in any meaningful way -- good luck running a competitive mining farm out of your house.

26434917	I agree with a carbon tax in general	I agree with a carbon tax in general but it misses the point when it comes to crypto. When it comes to domestic travel you can tax airlines directly; for manufacture it’s harder but you can in theory tax at the border. For cryptos, which were designed to subvert government control, there is no way to tax them since mining can just move to somewhere with less environmental controls.	paulgb	13.605212	1.9569491	comment	6.0	41.0	1615551143	-3.0768943

And honestly I think the solution is to declare war (whether via sanctions, violence, or some other means) on regions that are refusing to be responsible with the global ecosystem.I think it's a mistake to single out crypto as a unique actor in this growing issue, and that we should look for solutions that will generalize across all industries. Because all industries are contributing to the modern ecological crisis.And I'll add, crypto does not care if energy becomes more scarce. What crypto cares about is that energy is equally scarce for attackers and defenders. If, due to regulation of production, the cost of energy goes up, crypto will use proportionally less energy and keep chugging away quite happily.

Having them be discrete events is probably easier for someone to verify by eyeball, I guess, but it has the disadvantage that it creates moments in time where some large portion of the hardware in the market can suddenly no longer mine honestly and profitably.This decision seems to greatly increase an attacker's chances at obtaining a huge supply of hardware that is too inefficient to mine profitably, but can be used profitably for a short time to attack the network.I suppose Satoshi never imagined there would be specialty hardware used to mine, and that whatever commodity hardware mined bitcoin could find an	paulgb	13.5427885	1.8102742	comment	6.0	25.0	1681325224	-2.0194435

(Monero, Lelantus, CoinJoin, Wasabi, etc).Initial attacks (famously The Flashlight Attack) were capable of breaking the anonymity of targeted individuals, but this attack was later generalized (by me) to break everyone.These attacks never got a lot of coverage but they are highly effective.

It uses comparably very little energy and the difficulty is not substantially sensitive to energy efficiency because the cost is dominated by space rather than computation.There are other examples that attempt to use things like spatially distributed network bandwidth as a resource.

I finally decided yesterday to cash out of coinbase yesterday - they charged me £3 to withdraw my money!!
In the scheme of things I didn't lose that much money - not really. But personally I can't see myself getting back in when Bitcoin goes below 10,000 dollars (which I believe it will in 2023).

This is why money has been the first and most prominent use case; people are less trusting with their own money.For a specific non-money potential use case of blockchain I would say identity services. For example, currently the internet runs based on implicitly trusting a set of root CAs (hundreds just counting the big ones!).  The CAs certify that a site is what it claims to be.

This leadership (eg Ethereum foundation) gives crypto projects the air of legitimacy, but also the impression, as Hinman put it, that some managerial work and direction is expected, tipping the scale towards security. If the network becomes decentralized to the point where no one party has sway over its direction (even a good one eg the move to proof of stake), only then can you consider it a commodity, at least in Hinman’s view.Not only does this make sense but it also further speaks to the strength of the bitcoin project, specifically Satoshi’s decision to not be a public figure/BDFL.

That figure is harder to get at.Viewed this way, the additional purchases which seem foolish and laughable might even be signs of  success: perhaps Bitcoin business is booming so hard they need to expand their reserves?To be clear, I highly doubt that’s the case here, but if we’re going to assess success we should at least try to steelman their position.

It essentially lets you block all transactions from making it to the blockchain. Nodes will still verify all transactions and ignore transactions that are invalid.Edit: you can also create multiple forks and switch between them. External viewers will see both forks and if they don’t or can’t handle the difference they could experience a double spend.That being said any miner has the ability to sort transaction any way they want which can give them an advantage. So if someone has a lot of hashing power they can use that ability to delay certain transactions or to give preference to others.	pat2man	13.699658	1.6020552	comment	6.0	29.0	1580142412	-2.4981039

They aren't intended to be active participants on the network, they are intended to provide the service of securing the network and serving the interests of the users of the network.If a group of bodyguards at a concert vote democratically and 51% of them decide the singer shouldn't be allowed to go on stage and sing (because of a grudge or whatever), is that a problem? Yes absolutely that's a problem, and probably all of them are going to get fired.Same sort of idea here. If the miners aren't serving the best interests of the network, the network has no obligation to continue paying the miners tens of millions of dollars per day (no joke, that's how much miners on Ethereum make in revenue right now) to continue sticking around.

They are still scaling their infrastructure and when the price starts moving quickly everyone logs in to either get in on the action or take a look. This cranks the traffic up and the servers cant handle it.I am not excusing their behavior as they need to be able to handle it, especially when their server status affects the bank accounts of real people. But I feel that it is understandable with out condoning it. The simplest explanation is likely correct in this case.I don't think many of us could have predicted the volume and interest in BTC a year ago and neither did Coinbase's purchasing and infrastructure teams.	wonderwonder	13.668261	1.6274285	comment	7.0	58.0	1512673500	-2.0513942

If buying a hamburger cost you $30 in fees on top of the $6 burger, you'd stop using dollars for everyday purchases, too.Seems we're stuck in this situation so long as the block size remains where it is. That artificially reduces the supply of transactions, forcing the price up. No matter how many miners there are competing for those transaction fees, there can never be more transactions. The transaction market is really one half of a market, or a market with a ""supply ceiling"".It's ironic that Bitcoin's transaction count is essentially limited _by fiat_---by fiat of the Bitcoin code that implements the block limit.But given the relative failure of forks that increase that block limit, it seems Bitcoin is what it is and other"	pc2g4d	13.587884	1.5582992	comment	7.0	54.0	1512774339	-1.8011786

A peer is a node, which is a client that validates all transactions and blocks in the blockchain.  It is this understanding which forces people to respect the resource requirements of nodes, because any reduction in nodes is a reduction in peers.  Any increase in resources requirements must be carefully planned and implemented to ensure the security of the network is maintained.

The chance of success on any given project was always slim, but the potential payoff huge.  So, putting anything more than what you are willing to lose is reckless.	starkd	13.610259	1.3699881	comment	7.0	21.0	1669045585	-2.082597

And PoS is one of those ideas that most people looking at cryptocurrencies end up trying some variant of. PoW is obviously wasteful and it would be nice to improve on that. The problem is that it doesn't have the same properties as PoW have, and that are hard to do without.The problems are the basic ones, how to avoid colluding stakers, how to neuter the market for consumed stakes, how to deter chain splits.

Our Earth is already plenty rich in resources to scale up power requirements, and our sun provides near unlimited energy. The energy problem isn't unique to Bitcoin. Using a lot of resources is also the main benefit to the security behind proof-of-work because it makes building a duplicate ledger immensely impractical.

Right now the whole space is worth less than $100B, and it's going to be worth tens or hundreds of trillions of dollars.Obviously valuations have far outpaced the present usefulness of these technologies, but because the pie is so enormous it would be irrational not to overpay. Right now prices are too out-of-whack with reality so it's inevitable that there will be a correction, but it's entirely understandable why this is happening.It's sad though that most people on HN have now apparently become the older generation representing the entrenched interests, rather than being the disruptors.

Now I'm not so sure.Notably this 0.26 TWh/yr number doesn't include things like the energy used by each human to drive to and from work or the amount of energy needed to make the food that fed them that year but now we're getting into some anti-human territory.Perhaps the goal shouldn't be to minimize energy use but to maximize energy output.1. https://app.impaakt.com/analyses/paypal-consumed-264100-mwh-...	christiangenco	13.70756	1.8824512	comment	8.0	59.0	1656800480	-3.0196598

A technical approach (SegWit) was proposed and implemented by the Bitcoin developers in order to improve transaction capacity a couple years ago.

What you put there is your own responsability - so if you decide to create a virtual currency and either reward work or reward possession, its up to you - but that's on top of the ""blockchain"" concept.

As soon as a blockchain touches the real world, trust is required and the guarantees break down.Concretely: cryptocurrencies encapsulate the quantity of units within the blockchain. 1 BTC will always equal 1 BTC. This is why currencies are so far the only thing you can actually use with a blockchain.However, that doesn't mean you can trust the exchange rate (obviously, given Tether, but also, exchanges) or that you can trust the person you're transacting with. Or that you can trust the other actors not to scam you, steal from you or otherwise negatively impact your relationship with the blockchain.

Then make it hideously expensive for them to not use renewables. This way the bitcoin / cryptos would be for public good. They'd be incentivised to improve the world situation rather than be a burden.But governments are usually really bad at this sort of thing and they'd probably just mess it all up. It would likely involve a messed up website, multiple privacy violations, various forms of messed up bureaucratic red tape and all sorts of other anti-patterns.Also, incentives being incentives, forcing crypto miners to use, eg solar, would likely just spike the prices of renewables and cause other issues.Ok, I'm outta ideas.	kwdc	13.671007	1.8641336	comment	8.0	45.0	1622364456	-3.142859

This is admittedly a short-term solution.Bitcoin main, on the other hand, is moving toward SegWit, which introduces third-party middlemen. Service providers like Coinbase want this, because they get to be the middlemen.But critically, SegWit breaks the only long-term advantage Bitcoin currently has over Visa. SegWit isn't decentralized.

Some context may be helpful first, though. This paper is an innovation about one aspect of our technology. Algorand has a very fast consensus mechanism and can add blocks as quickly as the network can deliver them. We become a victim of our success. The blockchain will grow very rapidly. A terabyte a month is possible. The storage issue associated with our performance can quickly become an issue. The Vault paper is focused on solving this and other storage scaling problems.The Algorand pure proof-of-stake blockchain and associated cryptocurrency has many novel innovations aside "	naveedi	13.605363	1.429411	comment	9.0	38.0	1550505603	-2.164714

It had touched $0.85/$1 on October 2018 though.  It was discounted for the last quarter of the last year. The discount lasted for several months suggesting lack of liquidity and possibly lack of funds.The Tether discount suddenly disappeared. And suddenly a discount/premium appeared on Bitfinex. However, that discount was getting smaller everyday and almost disappeared (until a bit earlier but still negligible in the volatile crypto market).I personally hold a significant amount of USDT/Finex Dollars and not worried. I think the price is more relevant than the news. The probabilities or lack of funds will be builtin in the price.

There are a lot of industries that consume more energy than bitcoin mining.The reason none of this matters is because the market says it doesn't matter. The market is finding enough value from Bitcoin to keep running the network. Going forward, I think energy consumption won't matter because we are now producing more power than we can consume. For example, Germany had to pay citizens to consume power because there was a glut. Another example recently was in California where the state had to pay Arizona to take their excess capacity.The same is happening in China. China is heavily investing in alternate forms of energy and when you boil it down, it is still cheap to mine a 14,000+ USD bitcoin. In other words, the market says it's ok.	electic	13.699378	1.9459741	comment	9.0	46.0	1514410334	-3.3235343

The skeptics say ""what is it for?"" expecting a detailed answer, and the response from crypto enthusiasts is vague and high level; most of what I hear is heavy on words like ""revolutionize"" and ""decentralize"" but very, very short on specifics. Or I get argument by analogy to other technologies.If I heard a single use case where blockchain technology actually created real value in the world, and was better than other alternatives, I'd listen. But it has to create real value, based on the real world and not some fantastical notion of what money is or governments are for.I think we skeptics want a grounded narrative, and we're stuck hearing a thesis statement and nothing to back it up."	ryandamm	13.561817	1.4902285	comment	9.0	49.0	1642230031	-1.9016247

Something a bit like ICANN and the domain name system.Take 10 or so trusted people or organistions worldwide, get them to each run a node, each of which coordinate via the Raft protocol or whatever.

But it is probably possible to scale the transaction system off-chain - with https://lightning.network/ - which works like a protocol for writing and accepting checks. As far as I know Lightning is impossible or very hard without SegWit.

In contrast, anybody can become an ETH staker by purchasing the requisite amount of ETH (currently worth around $128,000, previously closer to $32,000) and make profitable return on it. You also retain a liquid asset that can be sold back at a later date. With the staking pools even this lockup amount can be reduced arbitrarily.For a consumer to participate in PoW based on current miners it seems like they need to buy perpetually out-of-stock specialized ASICs for a sunk cost of $10-15k with the expectation that the	TTPrograms	13.845704	1.5900098	comment	9.0	37.0	1638229109	-8.837857

Lots of people do that.Once you use Coinbase, you are out of the self-custodial crypto ecosystem and you pay a price for it. You give up all control over your assets. In return you gain convenience and the security of something backed by the US government.For some people that tradeoff is worth it, for other it isn't.

The idea that crypto is a ""store of value"" seems like meager coping with the fact that transaction rates in a distributed system necessarily must suck compared to what Visa, et. al. are doing with IBM mainframes and racks of x86 hardware contained in the same datacenter (i.e. 1~2ms latency domain vs seconds to minutes).For reference, Visa does thousands to tens-of-thousands of transactions per second. The cost to run one of these transactions is negligible because it can be handled so quickly. Contrast with BTC, which struggles to hit 10 transactions per second on a good day.

Obviously if Bitcoin succeeds so does Coinbase,  this is an Avenue to get exposure to that without having to invest in Bitcoin directly and since Coinbase makes money on volatility which Bitcoin has a tremendous amount you get to ride the swings up 	raiyu	13.657434	1.623968	comment	10.0	49.0	1613800071	-2.129884

I'm Vinay Gupta, the release coordinator for the Ethereum launch.Firstly, nobody believes that Proof of Work is here to stay - it's bleeding money from the currencies that use it at an astonishing rate, and as soon as Proof of Stake (or other algorithms) can replace it, they will. PoW is a direct financial drag on these economies, and it will not last long. Bitcoin will probably take longer to clean up its act than Ethereum, but that's largely for political reasons, not technical ones. Technically, it should be a lot easier to do than Ethereum, in fact. (It helps not being nearly Turing complete.)Secondly, brute force is how things begin. The Unix philosophy has always suggested using brute force first: premature optimization is the root of all evil, as they say.

https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Ethereum-Building-Smart-Con...The short of it is:- The block chain is a distributed ledger database, where all peers hold a full copy to avoid manipulation (faking an entry is only possible by controlling >50% of machines in this peer-to-peer network).- Spending money is implemented by adding a transactional record to the blockchain ledger at the end saying X amount moved from account A to B. A block is like a page in a paper ledger and they are appended with cryptographic hashes to avoid improper interference.- Ethereum supports smart contracts, which are little scripts in a language called Solidity. So you can implement legally binding (and unstoppable) contracts along the lines of ""if (condition) then (pay some money to someone)"	jll29	13.53234	1.2449102	comment	11.0	71.0	1663227507	-2.1436584

It was obvious that the Etherum merge would affect the bottom line in a big way. Why this professed ignorance? Does it have to do with the fact that to admit that it was visible a mile away would have been to admit the deep reliance the company had come to have on the short-term Ethereum mining boom?	yuan43	13.634902	1.3652607	comment	11.0	69.0	1664212147	0.708354

This is trivially falsifiable: blockchains are being used to facilitate illegal transactions.Of course, from there, people often wince. But that wincing comes from an assumption: that a transaction is morally just if and only if it is legal. This is a fairly bad assumption (particularly with a brief skim of the history of the 20th century), but even if it were true, it is provably the case that blockchain technology is solving this problem in a way previous solutions have not been able to, given it is the chosen mechanism.	gfodor	13.65461	1.289495	comment	11.0	93.0	1656081132	-2.2215505

You need to have a computer constantly online or your counter party can easily steal all your money. This leaves you vulnerable to all sorts of attacks.2. The lightning network works by routing payments through a network to your destination. The issue here is that the routing for the lightning network is extremely complicated and is currently an unsolved (and probably unsolvable) problem. The core issue is that you have to route money though a network where channel capacities are changing with each and every transaction.

A lot of crypto projects have all sorts of ways of obfuscating this or claiming that the intial coins will be destroyed or whatever, but I don't think that anyone has really succeeded in establishing trust on a large scale for this yet.The other method of getting Proof of Stake going would be migrate an existing Proof of Work coin.

Their legal entities shift based on what is needed at the moment. They have the ability to easily create tens of millions of dollars as needed based on their BNB reserves, tight relationship with Tether, their ability to launch new token projects (i.e. unregulated securities offerings), and their stablecoin BUSD. They act as an investment bank - I know a prominent crypto entrepreneur that got loaned 8 figures after a text message to help finance an acquisition.I would say it’s quite likely they are fractional reserve but they are so absolutely huge it would take a lot more FUD than exists currently to damage them even a little.

If you are located in the 'mining valley' of Washington where power is ~2c/kwh you are still getting healthy profits.A computer with 7 GTX 1070 graphics cards should produce ~230 mh/s and draw 1 kw. This would cost approximately $30/month in power factoring in kw demand + cooling.The above setup will currently generate $385/month in ETH.So basically for miners who are in the right spot with the right facility, this is still profitable. The question is of course for how long. You also need to factor in the cost of equipment, datacenter, employees and difficulty/price.But even if you dont have a facility in washington and just mine from your apartment, your power cost would probably be $100 a month.

Everything we do as a society I think should be from time to time evaluated from a point of view of benefits for society/world and then depending on this evaluation, the incentives should be updated to support things that we consider useful, and to penalize things that we do not. A few years ago Bitcoin didn't really register there, and it was okay to disregard. Now with so much energy/efforts spent there, one should ask oneselves, is it good allocation of resources? Is it good that so much cheap electricity is used for mining bitcoin? Can we think of a way of either taxing, or changing incentives, so that society benefits from this. I don't know what's the best way of changing the incentives, but it must be done in my opinion.	sega_sai	13.584469	1.8784466	comment	13.0	199.0	1613920695	-2.749723

I have never -- never -- encountered a value-producing use case for cryptocurrency that can't be solved by either signed git commits or a SQL database.Around 2015 a lot of people I thought were smart enough were exploring use cases for blockchain. AFAICT everyone in that space either left the space altogether, is still rambling about solving supply chain fraud (...), or pivoted to shovel salesmanship to support speculators (or speculate themselves).	thwayunion	13.541213	1.4364614	comment	13.0	130.0	1668190675	-2.0317748

Even seed investors who invested in Coinbase when it was founded would've been financially better off just buying Bitcoin/underlying.The situation here is unique because all of the popular coins have fixed supplies so any increase of popularity will have the commensurate increase in price. I don't see any situation in which Coinbase grows in price faster than the underlying.	endisneigh	13.66597	1.627564	comment	13.0	52.0	1617378883	-2.01106

Really useful nascent technologies all have this pattern—they grow incrementally more interesting and constantly gain applications.Bitcoin followed this pattern for a while. But then at some point it started to regress on that axis. You could no longer buy a pizza with it, you could no longer mine it, and it got too flooded by scammers to use safely. There's nothing to really DO with blockchain unless you buy into the subculture.

People don't need to continually invest in mining hardware to keep it going. The entire Bitcoin network could technically be run off a single Rasberry Pi.  The network hash rate is only so high because the ROI is there, but without it, people would still be mining.Case in point, there are plenty of long forgotten altcoins out there that people are mining just for fun.

However, it's widely suspected that Tether is unbacked and printing fake dollars and even Tether itself has admitted that at least 26% of their tokens have no backing [1]. Tether has never been audited so we have no clue how much of it is actually backed and how much of it is fake.This is extremely problematic because Tether is currently printing around $500 million per day and is a source of a significant amount of buy pressure in the market.

Surely, when we're spending in the billions on wasteful hashing, we could dedicate a small fraction of that to engineering better consensus algorithms.Unfortunately, we have an ecosystem where everyone is incentivized to ignore the problem because they're too invested in maintaining the price of Bitcoin and other PoW cryptocurrencies. They often don't pay for the externalities — environmental costs. The specialization of mining also severely hurts the distributed and decentralized nature of these crypto-currencies.I'm a huge fan of crypto-networks, and have made a career in the space.

Consensus rules don't change: If you see the threat of #1 and so take power away from miners (like Bitcoin has done), then you cannot ever change the consensus ruleset because aside from proof-of-work, Satoshi did not give any solution to the problem of choosing between 2 chains that have slightly different consensus rules.

With both of these (Bitcoin & HNS) you can still have 100% control over it if you choose to.So what if 90% of people decide to instead trust a third party with their holdings (like 100% now do with banks)?

Ideally, it goes from Tether -> USD -> USDC... and there lies the problem. We don't know if there is enough USD in Tether's coffer to redeem all the withdrawals. And if there is not, or even if there is a doubt about it, then it becomes a game where the last person to withdraw loses. How would that look for crypto in general?

Proof-of-work incentivizes cheap & renewable energy investment.The penultimate phase is custom off-grid mining farms that power themselves via their own renewables.

The comparison of ETH block vs Raspberry Pi. It is presented as if it’s some kind overlooked, unsolved issue by silly Ethereum developers. In reality, Ethereum is slower than Raspberry Pi by design, on purpose. It is meant to be runnable by a laptop and not taking the whole CPU.The whole space becomes a lot more interesting once you begin to question, hmmm, WHY do these supposedly smart engineers make decisions I don’t get? There is almost always a WHY. And that is a lot more curious outlook than crypto-bro bashing.And as a sidenote: why do we keep seeing these cheap shots at web3 and crypto regularly rising on HN?

Numerous proposals to fix the scaling issue have been proposed, the two main camps being ""increase the block size"" and ""muddle through by discarding less useful data"" (aka Segregated Witness/SegWit).  However, any changes require consensus from the miners who create Bitcoins and process transactions, and because it's not in their best incentive to do anything to reduce those transaction fees, no change has received majority consensus.In an attempt to break this deadlock, there is a ""Bitcoin Improvement Proposal #148"" (BIP148) that proposes a User-Activated Soft Fork (UASF) t"	jpatokal	13.770191	1.4325572	comment	18.0	220.0	1499921077	-9.152461

Then you have coinbase now trimmming to about the same number 3500, 590m revenue and a net income loss of 550m. That's right, as far as I can see, Coinbase loses $1 for every $1 of revenue.Firstly, I don't see how Coinbase needs as many people as CME. They're meant to be a disruptive start up they should be lean. Secondly, how the hell do they get those unit economics to work? It should be a trivial job, right.

While PoW is reliable and secure, it is also extremely energy intensive. To produce each block on the network participants are required to use powerful and energy-hungry GPUs to solve a complex mathematical problem.Alternatively, proof-of-stake (PoS) guarantees the security of the network in a different way. In PoS, anyone with 32 ETH can deposit that ETH to become a validator, a node that participates in the network's consensus algorithm. Finalizing a block requires 2/3 of all active validators to sign off on it.

Known as the “Difficulty Bomb,” it began slowing the creation of new transaction blocks in late 2016 and was expected to bring ether mining to a grinding halt a few years thereafter.> This time bomb has, however, functioned more like an alarm clock with a snooze button. In October 2017, when mining time had already nearly doubled to 30 seconds, the Ethereum team reset the clock, delaying PoW’s doomsday by about 12 months. And they will likely hit snooze again shortly.

I am NOT talking about the class of people who stake 32 eth to validate nodes. I am talking about the class of people with the ability to declare that the people with stakes did not validate correctly and therefore lose their stakes.

You would have to pay to have every single person on the network process that job for you, and it would be so big the network wouldn't even accept it. Rather, you would create a simple contract that says ""if you render this animation for me and prove that you did it right, I'll pay you X amount of Ether"".

The more valuable the collective Bitcoins are, the more energy you need to spend defending it against 51% attacks.To the apologists claiming there's no other good use for that energy, it's not simple.

But the author didn't realize that PoW is certainly doomed.PoW miners tend to spend more and more resources on finding blocks, until the cost approaches the rewards. But the rewards go up as the cryptocurrency becomes more popular, because the price and transaction fees go up. Therefore, a PoW cryptocurrency tends to ""eat the world"" as it becomes bigger.That's why Bitcoin is already approaching 1% of global electricity consumption, if it hasn't passed that point already. If the price were to go up tenfold, then so would electricity usage (roughly).

31703040	The problem I have with blockchain e	The problem I have with blockchain enthusiasts, after talking with them about their philosophy, is that they seem to consider trust a bug, and believe that ideal world is achievable with straitjackets of technical solutions that eliminate trust.Trust is a feature, not a bug. If trust is violated by rogue agents, it is because they exist[0], not because trust itself is a folly.However, blockchain-adjacent initiatives  seem to suggest a future where we implicitly label[1] every human as motivated to hurt another by making all aspects of their activities subject to verification checks.In addition to strong dystopian vibes, won’t this act of labeling everyone as potential threat actually be instrumental in bringing this motivation to everyone, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy?

27529423	There seems like a huge number of pe	There seems like a huge number of people who, at least in online discussions are skeptical of Tether's stability. And they may very possibly be correct? However, my question is why do virtually none of these people actually out money behind these views and short USDT?It's pretty cheap and easy to take a short position in Tether. You can borrow USDT on Compound for 3.37%, convert it to USDC at Curve for 0.06%, then collect 2.32% on USDC at AAVE. If/when Tether collapses, you'll only have to cover your short at the collapsed value.Many in comment sections like these will argue that Tether is less than 50% backed by hard assets. If you genuinely believed that to be the case, why would you not be happy to pay less than 1.5% per year to earn a 50% profit when the house of cards collapses?	dcolkitt	13.961902	2.0516636	comment	27.0	120.0	1623856412	-14.863231

It's really just simple arbitrage: if the value of Bitcoin goes up, but the electricity cost doesn't, then you have essentially 2 different prices for 1 good, which should attract more miners to spend more money on electricity. And, indeed, this is exactly what has happened.The problem, of course, is that if it takes an Argentina's worth of electricity to run Bitcoin now, how does the world manage if Bitcoin has a 10 or 100 times greater market cap? Obviously it can't, and world governments would rightly sh	hn_throwaway_99	13.682263	1.8985703	comment	28.0	167.0	1652646475	-2.760978
31494886	Someone help me understand this.All 	Someone help me understand this.All you need for a stable stablecoin is to save every dollar put in to it.  The people behind Tether sell tethers for $1, they save all of those dollars, and whenever the price of Tethers drops to $0.99, they buy tethers until the price is back up to $1.  As long as they never spend anything from the reserve, this can't fail no matter how unpopular the currency is - they can back the currency right up until they buy back the last outstanding tether with their last dollar.Of course, they didn't save every dollar; they spent some and invested some, presumably in things that have lost money recently.  But they should be solid as long as they have made more money on those investments than they've spent in salaries and yachts and what-not, and Tether was already 	ineptech	13.896347	2.0305424	comment	28.0	205.0	1653412666	-14.857535

If this trend continues the mining power will be so consolidated that a 51% attack will be likely. The Nakamoto coefficient is already at 4, and tending towards 3.- energy usage due to Proof of Work is growing astronomically, and the higher the price of bitcoin, the less incentive there is to use renewable energy. Bitcoin uses more energy than the country of Argentina.- transaction times are SLOW, and expensive. The lightning network is incredibly buggy and won't actually solve the problems it's promising.There is a better alternative.

I believe it was comparable to the energy consumption of Argentina.Advocates will defend this by saying most energy usage is renewable. This conjures the image of someone with a bunch of solar panels but the reality is that it's primarily hydro power because that's the cheapest. Thing is, in regions with cheap hydro power, the miners can use so much power they end up making power more expensive for everyone.I'd be more OK with this if crypto in fact solved a problem for most people. We should start by stopping calling them ""currencies"". They're not. They're assets.

Bitfinex produces it, though they're cagey (some would say outright lying at times) about the level of involvement.The primary purpose of tethers is money laundering, even more so than cryptocurrency generally. Bitfinex was cut off from the US financial system, which makes it impossible for them to clear USD-denominated wires. Their clients have ~$400M of USD on deposit with Bitfinex. Their solution: issue a cryptocurrency which is claimed to be 100% backed by USD and say that it is redeemable 1-to-1 for dollars... we just can't actually physically give you the dollars.Incredibly, this has worked so far.

Use cases like storing the history of a car on-chain, transparent supply chains, public voting... this all sounds interesting but never made it to product-market fit.I always assume that I'm wrong, so I'll keep looking for successful applications and I'm sure you can prove me wrong :)	hubraumhugo	13.62106	1.3358213	comment	30.0	570.0	1642227916	-1.9416062
