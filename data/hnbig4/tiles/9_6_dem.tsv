What if you're only getting a 5% fraud rate for something cheap and you want to just eat the loss and not have to manually deal with disputes? Or if you're selling something like a premium online account, you can just disable the user's account automatically if they dispute the charge.	gary_0	4.430035	-0.8246897	comment	3.0	20.0	1665321998	2.9314027

I've never had a payments problem with Stripe, while PayPal is consistently painful.I have a credit card issued by a bank in country X, but my home address both in reality and in bank X's records is in country Y.  This seems to consistently trigger that fabled PayPal fraud protection the article mentions, making it impossible to enter my information correctly.  After lots of poking about in the dark, I eventually figured out that the only way to make PayPal payments through this card is to set my country as ""X"" and enter a completely fictitious address in X with a separate delivery address in Y, after which the transaction sails through happily."	rippercushions	4.530544	-0.80696404	comment	3.0	14.0	1665324075	-1.2975266

    NEW: 3.49% + $0.49

It seems like some in-store payments might be slightly cheaper, but I don't want to misread anything. It's funny that they benchmark their in-store numbers vs Square, but decline to benchmark anything else. Their ""new"" online fee is now higher than Stripe, whereas before it was identical (Stripe is 2.9% + $0.30)https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/merchant-feesThe ""Why are we making this change?"" section never answers the question, of course."	simonsarris	4.4679794	-0.81720835	comment	3.0	25.0	1624113908	2.918599

It's a platform of platforms.The three products linked to in the article, Invoicing, Payment Links, and Capital, were three of the most requested features from our users. So we built them.And platforms use all of them to provide these services to their users. Invoicing's smart dunning enables 14% more revenue collection; Payment Links lets businesses get started with payments with no code (and no additional cost!); Capital not only gives businesses instant access to financing that flexes with income — but allows platforms to provide that fast financing to their customers.

Eight months or so after that, I asked about it, and they said they needed to freeze it for another six months. So soon we'll be at basically 18 months after the funds were earned.The whole thing is dumb though, so I honestly don't even attribute malice. It's a ~17 year old account and I've processed millions(?) of dollars through it.

Credit card transaction fees are insanely expensive as they're typically charged at a percentage of the purchase. For instance, if I pay my rent online with a credit card, I am changed a $100 fee. If there was an easy way I could pay my rent with Eth, the transaction fee would be a lot lower. So I can see this working in the following way:1) Stripe builds out the current functionality as a beta for accepting crypto payments.2) Stripe lowers fees and expands the merchant base.3) Stripe begins offering stable-coins on credit. Stripe is now Visa, but with way lower fees.	halpmeh	4.4443197	-0.82201415	comment	3.0	15.0	1669925088	2.9749136

The fact that JS library runs on every page and sends data back to Stripe, even before the app calls the API, is unexpected.

And, transactions can be anonymous and irreversible (depending on the currency).Critics will rightly point out those promises are not always kept (ethereum gas prices, for example), but they are the goals. Lower transaction fees, I would assert, are not the goals of PayPal.The problem is not technical. It's that there isn't mass adoption. If a well funded startup did a ""Fresno Drop"" they might be able to overcome that. That would be interesting and could be very effective.https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-fresno-drop/"	xrd	4.767024	-0.7738447	comment	3.0	12.0	1589922404	-1.320384

Other options like Mercury would be good. Though, if I recall correctly, the bank setup is optional, so you can skip it and pick your own bank after formation.Registered agent: The service they use was $100/yr (first year free).

Subscription numbers rose by over 50% overnight when including it as a choice (literally tens of thousands of people signed up after the change).Internationally, PayPal seems like the de facto choice for making online purchases.

PayPal called me to try and collect it from me, but I told them to fsck off: I had not explicitly authorized either Consumer Reports or PayPal.I didn't realize PayPal could dip into my checking account any time they wanted to.

I filed a dispute with paypal.  It was only for $30, was a digital item, and I had pretty conclusive evidence.  I expected paypal to side with me, especially given how long I had been using them and had never once filed a dispute.  Nope.  Immediately sided with the scummy company.

32263237	Stripe like paypal is not to blame i	Stripe like paypal is not to blame in this story. The problem is the credit card payment standard. Transactions can be charged back up to 180 days. This means that by giving the merchant the money right away, Stripe runs the risk that a transaction will be charged back and that the merchant wont have fund to cover it.Stripe like any other processor runs an algo to determine the risk profile of each transaction to decide if you get the money immediately or not. If you have a sudden high ticket transaction, the odds this will be charged back are much higher. This is why they freeze that money up to 180 days.It sucks, but it is how the credit card system works. Someone has to cover the chargeback risk.	aga98mtl	4.633536	-0.78996295	comment	3.0	11.0	1659010345	2.954967

Those users are often unable to use most other payment providers.	kelnage	4.769763	-0.77464306	comment	3.0	15.0	1520505129	-1.3943708

I spoke with people that worked on the system. Basically, sometime a long time ago, someone made some code that checked this. And over the years, many other parts of the pipeline ended up coding it and depending upon the same restriction. They're aware of it, but it's not a worthwhile time investment versus other work. People don't get hacked because of the limit, they get hacked via phishing, reuse, etc. Spending time testing, debugging, fixing old code across disparate systems with possibly different owners is a big cost. There's higher priority work to be done, even within security.	MichaelGG	4.7816586	-0.7754302	comment	3.0	20.0	1521479683	-1.3689456

It's not quite a 40% loss because I imagine if the PayPal option were removed a number of people would use the CC option instead of aborting the sale.Still though, that's a huge loss for an extended period of time. I definitely don't like what PayPal is doing but Stripe is also pretty evil in a similar fashion. If someone disputes a charge (due to fraud that Stripe is supposed to prevent but doesn't) then you lose the processing fee and you (the business owner) also get billed a static $15 fee on top of that.	nickjj	4.5799146	-0.8013399	comment	3.0	10.0	1557320347	2.9435155

But by necessity the bitcoin vendors will have to deal with it as a prime scenario, which means they'll either have to offer a meaningful user identification story (i.e. KYC or similar protocols) or offer a settlement period before the bitcoin is available -- credit the customer's account, but don't let them withdraw for 30 days / 90 days / whatever.This requires that the vendor take on some risk (because if they make the trade and the price moves but the trade is cancelled due to chargeback the price may have moved) and they have to price this in to the deal; maybe charging a premium for using PayPal, etc. This is all fairly standard and Coinbase, for example, had to deal with a ton of th	andrewla	4.759865	-0.7768072	comment	3.0	11.0	1603316236	-1.2456359

It must have been something you were considering. I'd be curious to hear why this was decided against?To be honest, none of the new Billing features are relevant to us.

The comment says they work at Stripe and live in Ireland, and they're just relaying factual information.This is why I'm so wary of ""tech press"" news like this. Having a vesting schedule for employer contributions is pretty standard for a lot of countries, not just Ireland. So this has been going on for literally decades, all across the world, but it's only when a tech company does it that it is framed as ""clawing back pension contributions"".I'm not saying this doesn't suck for employees or shouldn't be legally changed, but why are people OK with this practice for literally decades until a tech unicorn does it?"	hn_throwaway_99	4.4253826	-0.82329816	comment	3.0	11.0	1673804091	2.9944577

> In the presentation, Stripe said it generated $14.3 billion in revenue as it processed $816 billion in payments volume last year. The company’s so-called transaction margin before losses — a measure of net revenue — rose to $3.17 billion, or 0.38% of total volume. That compares with 17 basis points for rival Adyen NV, according to the presentation.Does anyone else feel these numbers aren't as high as expected? Sure $14B in annual revenue (and margins of ~$3b on that revenue) is nothing to scoff at. But $14B isn't even close to Amazon/Azure cloud big or even Amazon Ads big.Perhaps Stripe's valuation assumes a steep uptick in this revenue in the years to come?"

I always consider the written job offer to be ""interesting, but still in flux until we really accept, and they acknowledge receipt of my acceptance and we have a start date""Now - if Stripe is frequently rescinding offers after they've been accepted, and the candidate has let their company know they are leaving - that's a whole other ball of wax.Note:  This is also why you never let your current company know you are leaving until everything is completely signed/sealed/committed with the next company."	ghshephard	4.417879	-0.82675755	comment	3.0	10.0	1638372460	2.9235249

It's basically table stakes for competitive hiring these days. This includes everything from making a founder a celebrity in tech circles or on Twitter, to posting fake Glassdoor reviews (and getting negative reviews removed). The worst company I worked for would periodically send e-mails to everyone reminding us about the NDAs we signed and implying that they'd sue anyone who talked to the press or wrote negative things about the company online.If you're making judgements based on the frequency of good versus bad posts, your opinions are going to be dominated by companies pushing positive PR for themselves	PragmaticPulp	4.422902	-0.825538	comment	3.0	20.0	1638376930	2.9858775

The process is fairly simple - go to a small claims court, and ask the court to order them to give the money back.  They won't contest it, they will just return your money and close the account.That way, if it turns out that it wasn't your money, or you are a terrorist, paypal is no longer liable - they were just doing what the court ordered.	londons_explore	4.774569	-0.77481234	comment	3.0	26.0	1685024114	-1.2924504

We already have a company which we're happy about, we don't want to become a multi-national entity with all the liability that follows.So, question: Are you actively going to push Atlas as the solution to our problem as well?

I can login and reasonably easy see all of my MRC subscriptions, and cancel them as appropriate. Technically possible with credit cards directly, but not as nice.Best of both worlds right now is privacy.com for me, they generate credit card #s on the fly and provide that same level of vision and control into where the money is going with exactly 100% less bullshit and 100% less scumbag tactics.If you're moving payments away from paypal (and you should) I would suggest considering moving them to privacy.com instead of directly.

We’ve designed the program so that most offers take about 8-12 months to pay back, and therefore the repayment rate would change to reflect that projected duration (which would ultimately impact the APR). The 15% repayment rate you see on the landing page is just an example.We do think this is a significantly improved overall user experience—it works straight out of your Stripe account. It’s automatic, based on your sales. The cost of the loan is a single fixed fee that adjusts to the loan amount paid over the course of the loan—there is no interest rate or additional fees.

That said, this is a normal practice in the financial services industry regardless of provider.  I have worked with 100's of ecommerce clients over the years and whenever their chargebacks/refunds started going up (for any reason), their credit card processors would always place a reserve on the transactions.

Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including 500 errors."" which indicates that the idempotency functionality is created in a kind of layer around the main application functionality, and thus the request from the idempotency layer to the main app is not itself idempotent. So the idempotency key protects against faults on the network between the client and stripe's idempotency layer, but not against stripe-internal faults between the idempotency layer and the application. Is that the case? Why is the idempotency not achieved by usi"	felixhuttmann	4.4201736	-0.8285057	comment	4.0	24.0	1625414468	3.048736

That's unfortunate — I'll probably try to move the stripe stuff to a subdomain to avoid it — but I don't see it as a big problem.The HTTP security model is pretty awful, so there may be something I'm missing, but I did think quite carefully about this, and allowing people to use arbitrary HTML and JS was an intentional choice.Is there a particular threat model you see here?	wesleyac	4.42245	-0.82725865	comment	4.0	20.0	1631705995	3.034372

To integrate Stripe Checkout, we would have to ask the customer whether they're paying with a card or using PayPal prior to displaying the Stripe UI.While that is not the worst option, our current UX is similar to Shopify, where there is an accordion component with multiple options: PayPal, Credit Card, Apple Pay, etc..Stripe wants to fetch a premium with this feature. As such, they should bite the bullet and allow merchants to integrate PayPal as a secondary option (similar to how Apple Pay is displayed).I will say that this is a pretty nice improvement from the modal Stripe Checkout that has been around for several years.	ianhawes	4.4650283	-0.81786656	comment	4.0	53.0	1556123221	2.9513233

PayPal will never take your processing history into consideration if their algorithms decide that your account is connected to some account with past violations. This happened when my developer used his API keys on our production resulting in our account with 1M+ revenue/2 years (very few chargebacks if any) of operation banned. As a small startup, it was a death sentence for our business, finding another processor at high volume is difficult when you've no history to show!	xstartup	4.4771166	-0.8117012	comment	4.0	17.0	1517542389	2.995594

Most consumer cards are going to be significantly cheaper than 2.9% to process. Many people use ""check cards"" from their bank which are in that 0.05% category, for example. American Express and the top tier Visa and MasterCard rewards/business cards are the ones where interchange can exceed 2.9%.There are many ""interchange-plus"" merchant account providers now.

In my experience, the kind of skeptical user that insists on using PayPal because they don’t trust a given site with their credit card information tends to be more trouble than they are worth.

The other we only offered on Chrome and was paid through the Chrome Store. Thinking of all the work we'll have to do to manage accounts/payments/etc on the PDF extension almost makes me want to scrap the whole thing.Most frustrating is the migration. We have been live in the Chrome Store for 7 years, with varying prices. When someone subscribes, they are grandfathered at that price forever. But when we create our own payment system, how do we know what price someone was previously paying? We can either make our new customers really happy by charging all grandfathered users the lowest price we ever charged, or we can upset a bunch of our older customers	gnicholas	4.4320784	-0.82399905	comment	4.0	20.0	1600727600	2.8777459

Although many people here are asking about creating virtual banks and issuing cards to customers, it appears that the intended audience of this API is a business that has a Stripe account, that wants to be able to issue cards to employees/trusted officials that charge against that single Stripe account. There is no mention of issuing cards to external customers that link against their own, external accounts, right?I ask because the webhook that Stripe fires at purchase time is fantastic, and you could build some great things if their API gave you access to authorized real-time purchase data for customers.

I'm not sure the youngest remember what the payment landscape was before Stripe, but it wasn't great. Stripe lifted the whole industry up from mediocrity.Around 10 years ago I had the pleasure of setting up payments with a French bank: instead of a web API we had to use an opaque binary installed on our server. In terms of setup it took many weeks and several in person meetings to get approved. There was a (big) setup fee and a (not so small) monthly subscription. And then of course transaction fees.In Japan for startups targeting foreignland it was even worse: only PayPal supported payments in anyt	Xixi	4.442812	-0.8207259	comment	4.0	15.0	1568916387	2.9589915

And every api endpoint had an example, which is hugely helpful: HUGELY!  All the other API developers out there can learn from this: you can't underestimate the value of having a working example.

The only reason compromised accounts would trade for prices that high is because hackers have a high success rate of stealing funds from them, and a low chance of getting caught.Credit cards and bank credentials being worth comparatively much less means that hackers don't have easy ways to secure the funds - either there's a high risk that the transaction is reverted, or there's a high risk that the hacker gets caught and goes to jail. You can tell it's not just an effort issue because the value of the accounts barely scale as the amounts in the accounts increase.	Taek	4.7724986	-0.774855	comment	4.0	16.0	1594652376	-1.4285725

Stripe would normally take 2.9% which is $7,250 but now with ""fraud production"" they would take 3.3% for $8,250. So you've just spent an extra $1,000 out of pocket to save yourself $15 in a dispute fee that Stripe charges you.

I suspect that's the legal reasoning that's caused PayPal to adopt this policy.PayPal could and should find a better way to handle transitioning people who, out of necessity, lied about their age when they first signed up. Was signing up under false pretenses a form of fraud? Probably, but it's a form of fraud that's essentially benign and is so pervasive, online and off, that it's just stupid to treat it as such.	jcwayne	4.776945	-0.77458304	comment	4.0	13.0	1493480566	-1.6126221

Normally, one must be 18 years old to enter into a contract, so the policy of preventing users under 18 from using the service is rational. However, if a user under 18 turns 18 years old during the contract, the contract is ""ratified"" and becomes valid and enforceable. It's as if they were 18 years old all along. So, there is no legal reason for Paypal to terminate accounts for people who enter into the contract under 18 yet turn 18 during the contract period."	joshuaheard	4.775503	-0.7728668	comment	4.0	32.0	1493493509	-1.4154823

If you joined then, it could have been prohibitively expensive to do an 83b election.  The whole point of RSUs is that you don't owe anything until there is a liquidity event, unlike options which you may be required to exercise or lose while the company is still private.However, RSUs only get this favorable treated (i.e. you've been given something of value, but can defer paying taxes on it) because they technically expire worthless if the company does not have a liquidity event in time.  	bzax	4.4147034	-0.8289064	comment	4.0	25.0	1678216838	-7.6739492

A real criminal who has their account shut down is probably going to be pretty aware of what the reason is.

Hopefully if they're now rolling out more comprehensive fraud protection, that will go some way to addressing all of those concerns, so best of luck to them with this new development.Edit: It appears there's a small per-transaction charge for their enterprise customers on custom plans but it's now included for free with the standard pricing.

I'm a former (early) YC founder, and during my batch the YC team recommended that we spend time with the HN team. The HN team gave us edits on our posts, recommended the best times of day to submit, emailed us when stories about our companies hit the front page, and explained how the ranking algorithms worked (and thus we learned how to game them).

If they didn't actually have any crypto, in the event of a large scale increase in price combined with a large scale cash out, Paypal would have to eat the difference from buy to sell price.  They would lose their shirt.  At minimum, Paypal is buying some percentage of the crypto sales in actual crypto to act as a hedge.  However, it is more likely they are closer to 1 to 1 backing since they probably believe that there will be large upward movements in the future and they believe they can make money on both the spreads and the actual bitcoin (assuming they ever care to sell it).	liquidify	4.7747626	-0.7736933	comment	5.0	23.0	1613057735	-1.4497764

I ask this as a person who has moved a couple businesses off Stripe, pricing & corner cases like easy debit support are the main two motivational factors.For example, Centurylink lets you pay online via debit card with just the card # alone. No CVV, address, expiration date, etc. For low fraud industries, this is a way to leverage very cheap debit card rates (eg $0.65 flat for small bank/credit union debit & 0.05% + $0.21 for large banks that are regulated debit), while making it simple to use debit cards compared to a credit card. If Stripe were to offer something like this, it would be a harder sale to make when I come in and review their phone/payment processing/ISP bills and pitch them $XXX savings.Another thin	posguy	4.430182	-0.82253945	comment	5.0	28.0	1491945293	2.9939623

Not the ones you have voluntarily put in.This is pretty standard here (at least as far as tech companies go). It's literally written in the freaking contract.It sucks, but we all read our contracts when we signed.The reason I can see an employer doing this is to serve as a retention mechanism. But it obviously doesn't work when people get laid off.	_trackno5	4.4184675	-0.8263434	comment	5.0	22.0	1673803288	2.9434297

We're being hit with 4.7% PayPal international fee, then ~ 3.75% fee to convert USD to our local currency to withdraw to our bank account. (PayPal won't let us withdraw USD.) Then another 2-3% to convert it back to USD in our bank to pay our supplier in USD. Imagine the total.And the number of our PayPal-paying customers keeps growing. For some mysterious reasons it is convenient for people in very remote parts of the world to use PayPal.

Stripe has to pay $3.5B in taxes. This is unrelated to employee stock.2. Lots of long term employees have expiring options, and if they exercised them they would face a massive tax bill.To solve both 1 & 2 Strips is doing an additional raise of $2.3B from private investors which will (1) give them money to pay that tax this quarter and (2) let employees exercise their options and sell shares to the same investors ($600M worth) – so basically a buyback event.	paxys	4.414178	-0.8249146	comment	5.0	22.0	1678313831	-7.5240545

But consider the size: If the tax bill is 3.5B, the full size of the grants we are talking about here is over 10B! last valuations in the press are at something like 60b. So 1 in 6 shares in the secondary market? Might as well be an actual IPO.Without 2022 going the way it did, I'd have expected that there would have been yet another regular round, where the investors ate enough common stock for current and former employees to vest the RSUs.

32855838	The difference is between the compan	The difference is between the company having their own merchant account with a bank (which is what most large companies do) using an online payment gateway, and not having one and leveraging the processor's instead (which is what Stripe, Paypal, etc provide). When you apply for a merchant account you get that approval and underwriting, but with a hefty application fee for obvious reasons. If your payment gateway shut you down, you can just switch to a different one, but there'd be little reason for them to do so. Your bank is much less likely to shut you down, because you were preapproved. The main reason would be for high fraud/chargeback percentages.When you use Stripe or Paypal or similar, you don't apply for your own merchant account. You make transactions using their merchant account.	joecot	4.505369	-0.81175894	comment	5.0	36.0	1663264252	2.864673

a bank or payment processor has frozen or shut down an account and you’re getting stonewalled it’s almost guaranteed to be an AML related issue and it’s against the law for them to tip a customer off that their account is being or might be investigated for suspicious activity. This isn’t Stripe deciding that you’re a fraudster and so you’re undeserving of help. This is Stripe doing business in compliance with the law. I’m not saying that makes it acceptable but if you’re upset about the behavior described in this post call your Senators and Representative to complain about the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act; they’re to blame for this sort of frustrating non-response."	elliekelly	4.4220386	-0.8257322	comment	5.0	34.0	1663264263	3.0252292

I got an email from Stripe, sharing an opportunity to post your landing page and get feedback from Stripe's design team. That Friday I got an awesome teardown from Stripe's design team. The page (https://nanagram.co) still has quite a ways to go, but I incorporated most of their feedback and I'm super happy with it. Another cool thing — Through the grapevine I found out Patrick mentioned NanaGram at an all-hands meeting. I sent him a quick email to say thanks for the mention, not expecting a reply whatsoever, and within a few hours he responded. Stripe's kind of mind-blowing in their ability to not only build a great product but also to serve the community and be human.	aacook	4.418745	-0.8277776	comment	6.0	28.0	1538016562	3.0542226

For example `POST /users` now takes a required field `avatar_url` but it was not part of `v1`.Since this field is validated in the DB, merely having `v1` `v2` distinction at the API layer is not sufficient. So I was thinking we will have to either 1) disable DB validations and rely on app validations or 2) run two separate systems (e.g., one DB per version) and let people 'upgrade' to the new version (once you upgrade you cannot go back).Even though people refer to Stripe's API versioning blog, I don't recall any mention of actual data model changes and how it is actually managed	ceeker	4.4235044	-0.835403	comment	6.0	27.0	1647058794	2.885864

In order to really customize things to the point where it looks unique would require being a designer in which case, you probably have your own components already.And since it's closed source, we likely won't see a huge influx of custom looks to these components like we do with Bootstrap. I hope Adam addresses that by eventually making multiple variants of each component in each kit so we have some variation. Even just a few well tested color palettes would help initially.	nickjj	4.427072	-0.8356229	comment	6.0	26.0	1583158705	3.074852

It made absolutely zero difference out of the box. ""-Is it a 100th charge coming from the same IP in Ukraine with a Canadian VISA? No problem, charge approved, here's your success webhook."". ""-Same fake TLD for the email address, for a customer number 2235?

There's a bagillion compromised PayPal accounts actively scamming people. It's why PayPal G&S is the gold standard for buying stuff from people online.

A bank account can become dormant if there are no deposits or withdrawals over a specified period of time as determined by the governing state. For California, it's 5 years, but for other states, it can be as soon as 12 months. Once an account becomes dormant, the holding bank is required to send the funds to the state through an escheatment process. Those funds are then listed as unclaimed property.PayPal is not a bank, but but rather operates banking services performed through Synchrony Bank.

I have never felt more appreciated and well treated than interviewing there.1) they always give feedback2) they have more generic positions, get you in the door to some small filter interviews, and then shop you around to find the right team for you, instead of the reverse approach where people shotgun resumes across your company trying to get in the door. The problem with the recruiter and multiple HMs I talked to at stripe is they didn't seem to care about getting people to work at stripe, only getting people to work in their org which didn't have open positions for X.3) incredibly quick and responsive through the process. My recruiter at stripe did this!Love what you're doing for science,

But two days ago I thought of Stripe as a top notch company, with top notch leadership. Since I'm well aware that PR is a thing, that reputation also tends to be brittle, but while nobody had said anything bad about Stripe, I thought they were tops. This is not so much about Stripe as about the PR world we've created: we know that everything we're told is polished to make it look as nice as possible, so when the facade cracks, we should adjust heavily.So now I'm going to have to shift my priors, and it may well be unfair to the firm. For one, I don't know if the allegations are true.

And a review is expected to be more like auditing your customers entire financial history than just asking what they meant by a word, so for a consumer service like PayPal the only real option is to block the transaction.

As an informed technical person, I would much rather hand my CC to Stripe than to PayPal, but Joe Sixpack doesn't feel the same way. Their impression is that they're giving randome websites their CC information, when actually Stripe's architecture is very reasonable.If this affected conversions in a meaningful way for my business, I would have a hard time justifying not using PayPal instead of Stripe.	gomox	4.490031	-0.81360036	comment	7.0	36.0	1520522584	2.898867

Part of what makes Home work well for us is how tied it is to how we actually work day-to-day -- that regularly changes as we grow and learn. As an open source project, we'd feel a commitment to keep it working for the existing user base, which might perversely hold back progress on Home and be a net negative for the community as Stripe itself tries new ways to operate.For now, we intend to continue sharing the lessons we learn from Home and similar tools so that others can benefit from that, and to keep open sourcing it in the back of our head as we design the underlying APIs and infrastructure so we have optionality if it makes sense down the line.	michaelschade	4.4206386	-0.82699263	comment	8.0	32.0	1524168925	3.0001948

We're less focused on a business just using it for their own expensing (as we don't have receipt upload functionality, etc).To your two other questions though:(1) Could users approve things in real time? Sort of. We provide the ability (as you noticed) through API, but it needs to be responded to in < 2s, which means it's not possible for a human to be in the flow.(2) Could this be linked to an external bank account? Again, sort of. To get in the weeds: as soon as we approve an authorization, we're on the hook for those funds. A	lachyg	4.4250293	-0.8267101	comment	8.0	72.0	1532632307	3.027142

I love Stripe, but I feel like this is awful advice for API-first companies.If you are building a developer product where your API is your business, using rate-limiters is akin to preventing customers from giving you money. If your product is an API, you should encourage usage. The more usage you get, the more success both you and your customer will have. It's a win-win.Because of this, I believe implementing rate-limiting strategies result in not only poor-DX for the product, but also a loss of trust (if these limits are in place to prevent your backend from failing, what other things do I need to worry about while using your product?), AND most importantly, they result in loss of business for both the API company and the customer.IMO, if you're an API company, and you 	rdegges	4.433652	-0.829689	comment	9.0	38.0	1490899589	3.0767505

Our goal was to build a flexible billing system for all kinds of companies at different sizes, but we were definitely focused on smaller (doing maybe $100k–$10M of ARR) SaaS companies to start. We've come a long way since then and now power billing for a number of large/public companies. Atlassian, Figma, Notion and Slack are either using or migrating onto Stripe Billing today.Stripe Billing is a powerful tool with a r	kurrik	4.4281006	-0.82571787	comment	9.0	79.0	1665681051	2.9249213

It's no foundation at all.	chmod775	4.7540574	-0.77683944	comment	10.0	79.0	1557402012	-1.3212183

National banks (CIC, Caisse d'Epargne) both offered % way, way lower than stripe (under 0.5% per transaction, stripe being almost 3* that for European card and 6* that for non European card).Even including the small monthly fee and the harder / higher cost integration, it made no sense to go with them.Was a bit surprised, mostly by the good terms that could be obtained in locally national banks once you sit with someone.

So with this logic, Stripe's valuation would be almost exactly where it currently is.Yes, a lot of former employees could have become liquid. But a lot also would have had money tied up exactly the same way it is now, except on a much more volatile public market where their every move would be much more scrutinized.They're now providing liquidity to employees via this fundraise, too, which solves the only major drawback I can see with not going public earlier.	gkoberger	4.4159184	-0.8264375	comment	10.0	93.0	1678920091	-7.483463

Stripe Atlas really ought to make the default an LLC.The two major reasons why:1. When you're a C-corp, you pay taxes twice. Once at the corporate level, and once at the individual level. This matters both for ongoing income but also for any liquidation event - as most liquidation events are asset, not stock, sales, you're getting taxed twice here too.2.

I'm sure many people in SV would move if they thought they could keep 90% of their TC in another area. That said - it only stays true if they stick with Stripe.

It’s worth distinguishing between charging money on Stripe (for which you incur payments pricing) and using Stripe Billing (which is a separately-paid product).Stripe Billing has had this pricing for a few years. For some longtime users of Subscriptions, we originally didn’t change their pricing but are doing so now. We think charging a separate fee for our Billing product is fair, given comparable products in the market (say, Recurly or Chargebee) charge something similar. (Generally more!)We’ve been investing a ton in making Stripe Billing better. For example, from talking to users we learned people needed it be significantly easier to get up and running with subscriptions. So in the last year we built the Customer Portal[0].

I'd say it would be more worthwhile to pay an accountant to do that for you, and save the ongoing fee. You will have to pay an accountant anyways to do your tax returns. I'm an accountant and my firm often does sales tax returns for our clients.

I was a loyal customer for 20 years until I wanted to convert my account from business to personal (I closed the business) and the site refused to do so. after months of calls with support, it became clear that no one was able to do this (something locked the flow and no one was able to see what; I guess my account was so ancient, it has some db flags no longer used but still checked by their backend?), so I asked just to terminate my account. That also was not possible. It took 6 months to figure out why; my company still existed they said; it most certainly did not. It took 2 months to find out why they thought that; apparently, somewhere in the past 20 years, they searched for my company in the NL company register and attached the wrong company number to 	tluyben2	4.7825794	-0.77459544	comment	14.0	89.0	1667550901	-1.3401045

If you have to ask everyone to reset their password because your auth provider increases their pricing or goes out of business, the churn will likely kill your company.I would say the same for Stripe, but at least they'll help you migrate off their platform. Auth providers cant help you because the passwords are hashed... You need the same algo or you cant authenticate using the data they have.And the only way off without a mass password reset is a silent migration in the background: migrate the user when they login.. but we all know that will take months and you will never get 100% to login during the migration period.Pick an auth provider and you better believe in their business as much as 	rgbrenner	4.427891	-0.82606983	comment	14.0	118.0	1620932018	3.0047414

Adyen only goes after large businesses and has something many others, including Stripe cannot compete with efficiently: (far) lower pricing, higher market coverage.The developer experience for Adyen is decent - no complaints, perhaps a bit less “magical”.

2) to help prevent against fraud which was becoming a massive problem at the time.  If the number was stolen, it immediately wasn't good anymore and a hacker/thief could not use the CC number to purchase/steal anything.It was that second aspect that I thought would totally eliminate all credit card fraud and make people comfortable with online purchases on smaller sites.

Underwriting means they look over the business model, financials, etc and make sure the business is an acceptable risk, not doing anything illegal or against their terms, etc. So you’re more likely to be declined initially, but if you’re lit up, you should be good for the future because the underwriters actually saw the deal and approved it.While I haven’t worked for these other companies, a lot of experience seems to show that Stripe, Square and PayPal op	orionint	4.469134	-0.8170709	comment	18.0	166.0	1663261494	2.9306304

Now 15% of my sales go toward repayment.  Let's say I pull in a little over $30K in sales a month.  The loan will be repaid in about six months, and my effective APR is 20%!

You just get more functionality than before for free. This is what we generally try to do: we want Stripe to continually become better value for you over time, as you get more functionality for the same price.- What we've seen over Stripe's history is that customers handling large amounts of revenue have been forced to pay substantial amounts for expensive third-party systems. So, we've decided to build something that we think will be better and cheaper -- and that will, over time, increase the net revenue of businesses built on Stripe.I'm sorry about any confusion in our commun	pc	4.422505	-0.82564235	comment	20.0	168.0	1522953682	2.9783974

Ideally, you'll support at least two providers you can switch between, if you can afford the development of supporting two, as at one point or another, it'll save your ass or at least a bit of money as fee structures change between providers. It'll also be easier to integrate a third one in the future when you eventually find the perfect one (until they turn into the next Stripe).> Dispu	capableweb	4.435671	-0.823085	comment	21.0	156.0	1675256829	2.977764

(The news is that we're now applying this pricing to Stripe's older users, in part as a response to some price increases that the card networks are making.)- Our policy on refunds is pretty much the same as Braintree's.- We've added a lot of new functionality to Stripe since we launched in 2011. (The Stripe that launched back then did not support any non-card payment methods, non-USD currencies, non-US users, etc.) The vast majority of new features come with no new fees -- the Stripe package just gets better.

The credit card companies literally have no control over who can charge us.If anyone at stripe is reading this, I think this is golden opportunity for consumer focused payment service.

So I am going to ask what may seem like a stupid question to some of you.I mean this in as polite a way as possible, but why wouldn't established companies like Stripe just fuck off to another city entirely? It's a successful company with a great product - that I'm sure many people would like to work for. They could surely lure talent from the bay area by moving to a lower cost of living area where mid-level employees can afford to buy an actual house relatively close to work? And they could pull a mini-Amazon and get some sweet tax breaks to boot. Is there some hidden reason that companies like this insist on staying in the same area despite the many potential advantages of looking elsewhere?	dawg-	4.3938484	-0.8210398	comment	30.0	204.0	1571921838	2.9403048
