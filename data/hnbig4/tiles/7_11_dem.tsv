If I saw the amp logo, I knew that was the one to click.Abusing users with bloat is supposedly some great freedom worth fighting for, but AMP forcing these developers into a much smaller box that they can't screw with users as much on I just loved AMP.I think a lot of the HN hate comes because AMP I think prohibits random third party javascript ad libraries. So obviously it hits folks where it hurts, but the web is much nicer to browse without all the junk.	random5634	2.513343	5.882328	comment	3.0	30.0	1616537658	-10.116188

15086618	The main reason Google caches the pa	The main reason Google caches the pages (when a user comes from Google search) is so that the page can be preloaded by the browser before the user even clicks. This preloading is part of the reason that the experience is so fast.If Google preloaded the page from a non-google server, there would be a few problems. The most important one is that it would violate the user's privacy. That server would have in it's logs a request from a user that didn't click on the article, and could intuit information about the user's searching behavior from that request.Less importantly, without the page being served from Google's cache, there is no way to guarantee it's actually a valid AMP page. The only thing Google knows is that it was valid AMP the last time it was crawled, which could be days ago.	gregable	2.5120177	5.883473	comment	3.0	11.0	1503534965	-10.101778

As a user however, I'd want Sourceforge's rankings go down the drain because it uses (directly or through its advertisers, doesn't matter) such a bad practice of getting users to click on the ads.

Chrome (with the V8 engine), NaCl, SPDY, QUIC, PWA, Dart, Certificate Transparency ... the list goes on and on. Some have succeeded (SPDY became HTTP/2) and some have failed (Dart, NaCl), but it has been consistent at least.Standards cannot become a strait-jacket. In many cases (such as HTTP/2) the standards have come much after the concept was proven. Though Dart and NaCl failed, they triggered improvements in Javascript and also led to WebAssembly.AMP was created as a response to Facebook's Instant Articles. If anyone supports the open web, then it is hard to see how things become better if the web stays stuck as more content moves into walled gardens, or the we	sseth	2.5117316	5.8828607	comment	3.0	16.0	1519548783	-10.140561

Most people who invent web frameworks just put them out there as their own arbitrary unilateral design like Django, React, etc. and if enough people sign on board it's a thing. Web components was the one time when someone who wanted a new framework, actually put the time and effort into attracting the involvement of the browser authors and web consortium and standards bodies. That's a real long road and it's incredibly hard. Google did that. It's something worth respecting, even if web components don't feel all the great to code.Beyond being a web component framework, I have no idea who the hell these AMP	jart	2.513152	5.883103	comment	3.0	12.0	1608299532	-10.126746

I haven't seen anyone try to justify this; for whatever reason it's not on anyone else's radar that I've seen.  For me it's a total deal-breaker.If you want a standard you can specify a standard, if you want a framework you can specify a framework.  But requiring it to give you client-side permission to run scripts is something that requires more justification that I've seen anyone give.(I haven't checked the official amp website in a year or so, maybe things have changed since then).	jan_Inkepa	2.5123856	5.8832235	comment	3.0	10.0	1608302192	-10.158202

But Google's main goal here is to preload/render content without the content knowing it is being preloaded, so that the page appears to load instantly when the user clicks on it.What I think actually needs to happen is a standard for deferred navigation where the UA can be told to load a bunch of resources and then choose one of them to actually navigate to (basically what AMP does). The problem here is that Google is (as we type here) actively coming up with horrible standards like signed exchanges so that they never have to send users away from their own domain, so I don't think they would be fans of a standardized system that killed AMP.	snek	2.5104	5.884432	comment	3.0	11.0	1564866552	-10.111376

There's the Ad people ( add 2-3 external services ) there's the online marketing team ( add 10 more tracking tools ) then the UX guys have 2-3 tools to play with... The list is probably a lot longer. That's why sites like Mashable used to load 30+ external services (now 13). It all adds extra markup (static and generated), DOM manipulation, network traffic and all sorts of crap that slows pages down.AMP-ing means saying no to all this by design.

Webpage speed is a fair measure (and I really wouldn't know what I could do to make my pages any faster, AMP will not make a measurable difference).I would expect an un-biased search engine to rate pages with and without AMP equal and to not show 'badges' based on whether or not a page uses tech by the same vendor of the search engine.	jacquesm	2.4940386	5.901212	comment	5.0	26.0	1476705027	-10.105394

Several organizations do it and do it well (DotDash dominates the board with their sites).https://webperf.xyz/Before I hit API limits on WPT I was also testing against the AMP version of the page too.

For the millionth time, you don't need AMP to improve your website performance. The reason there is ""better performance"" in the AMP vs non-AMP pages according to this article, is that there are fewer assets and objects to load in the AMP pages due to some of the restrictions AMP imposes.In other words, load fewer assets, write less code, and you'll have better performance.AMP is still bad, and it does not itself make the web faster."	elliotec	2.5141559	5.8818936	comment	5.0	45.0	1565645306	-10.117675

This is used to minimize page rendering artifacts for the end user, which is one of AMP's main goals, content should be fixed.The problem however here is that this animation is usually triggered before the 8s, as soon as the AMP javascript has been served from the CDN.

It smells to me like Google is trying to use its dominant position in search to reduce consumer control of the browser; it's a risky road to go down for everyone, including Google.For me, as long as I disable javascript, the modern mobile web is plenty fast enough. That is, the bits of the web I want to use on the move: mostly text, occasional pictures. It takes real effort to break this with javascript disabled. Most JS on e.g. news sites, blogs, aggregators etc. is tracking and ad related, dynamically adding links to viral content, all that stuff you don't need and dramatically slows down sites through repeated reflow.	barrkel	2.5120027	5.881985	comment	6.0	57.0	1471352752	-10.104679

Like on the web the form of AMP used by Google and Cloudflare.Starting with google: AMP does not actually make loading any faster. Google just uses it's search monopoly to make it seem so. When you use google search with javascript enabled AMP results are both prioritized in the listing and pre-loaded in the background. This makes up the entire increase in load time you perceive. AMP pages not pre-loaded by google are just as slow to load.At Cloudflare there are other problems. If you're a CF customer and have the option enabled, your AMP page hosted on CF servers will do some nasty stuff. Specifically outgoing links to third party domains will be mirrored onto cloudflare's servers and re-hosted. Present	superkuh	2.5119836	5.883186	comment	7.0	63.0	1561299791	-10.127482

They make the Web a worse place for the sole benefit of Google.

Big sites enter into contracts with major brands for full page advertisements, which could include contractual requirements that theirs is the only ad on the page. Serving and decorating a site would create headaches for us to explain why their ads weren't alone.The iframe also reduced engagement as reader would only read the embedded article and move on.

Mobile Safari had a bug where iframe scrolling is different from scrolling in the rest of the system. On every Android browser, it works just fine.Similarly, that Mobile Safari's reader mode doesn't work with AMP is simply because it doesn't understand iframes and doesn't work on canonical URLs, unlike every other reader mode (both websites like outline.com and browsers like Firefox) I have used.The real issue is that Safari is such a buggy, rarely updated browser that publishers have to choose betwee	lern_too_spel	2.5120618	5.883004	comment	8.0	72.0	1519165252	-10.130946

The rise of the mobile phone app is a threat to Google on so many levels from ad revenue to data for training its AIs.So Google comes up with Amp to convince publishers to keep their content on the open web, where it can be collated, indexed, and otherwise used by Google for Google's services like search and those search result cards that keep people from visiting the content creators.Google's explicit carrot in all this is the user benef	reaperducer	2.5128832	5.882435	comment	10.0	36.0	1593847019	-10.08229

However, AMP solved the political/bureaucratic problem by providing a strong carrot to make a non-shitty version of the web site, and made it easier to make a non-shitty one than a shitty one.The publishers already have to spend time remaking their web site, and the goal they get provided with is ""keep it simple and lightweight"", and doing shitty things is made hard/expensive.

This makes it easy to navigate back to Google (why would you ever want to leave?) and other publishers in the AMP ecosystem, but much harder to navigate to the publisher that created the page in the first placeIn essence, this means that what was once a publisher-owned page is now shared property: between the Google and the publisher. By controlling the top navigation, Google more easily controls the content the visitor sees, keeps visitors on Google longer, provides greater opportunity to track visitors, and perhaps most importantly has the opportunity to earn more ad revenue.No	cyrusshepard	2.5111141	5.8839	comment	14.0	117.0	1476757614	-10.107501

Which means most big sites not using AMP are slow because most places don't have direct incentives for keeping their stuff fast. Against all odds, AMP convinced these sites to build an alternative experience that's reasonably fast. It's good that AMP is no longer required to get good rankings for fast pages. That was always a silly requirement. But from a user's point of view, I'm grateful for AMP, despite that being an unpopular opinion around here.	bla3	2.511744	5.8835583	comment	14.0	87.0	1616537389	-10.116196

Google's goal with Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and similar technologies is to keep users on Google-hosted content as much as possible, and Chrome for Android already modifies the address bar on AMP pages to hide that the pages are hosted by Google.	khaledh	2.525014	5.8702383	comment	15.0	183.0	1597410422	0.09668575

Google throttles the load time of non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second delays in order to give Google AMP a “nice comparative boost.” Throttling non-AMP ads slows down header bidding, which Google then uses to denigrate header bidding for being too slow. “Header Bidding can often increase latency of web pages and create security flaws when executed incorrectly,” Google falsely claimed. Internally, Google employees grappled with “how to [publicly] justify [Google] making something slower.”I’d be seriously ashamed at this point if I was a Google employee assigned to AMP.	robin_reala	2.5124788	5.8831096	comment	15.0	162.0	1635057357	-10.111413

Interesting...You know I don't understand this whole AMP'd thing. It's possible to make something just as efficient if you don't ruin your mark-up to begin with. The big advantage with AMP, as far as I can tell, is the Google caching mechanism. There is no reason someone can't use actual standards to create the exact same results.It really bothers me that, to get preferential treatment, I have to now work with Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles. If I don't the competition will. We originally had web standards for a reason, now we're doing this non-standard stuff.	BinaryIdiot	2.5119731	5.883441	comment	15.0	120.0	1474400428	-10.111211

Otherwise, how do I know which bias to apply? On iOS, the title bar says ""google.com"" whether I'm reading an article from CNN.com or WashingtonExaminer.com.Of all the anti-competitive actions google has taken around search results, AMP is by far the worst. I hope they get smacked down for it in the upcoming anti-trust lawsuit. And kudos to Apple for refusing to change the URL bar like Google does on Android."

Before AMP most of the web was unusable on slower Android phones and frontenders just laughed at you and told you to drop 800$ on an iPhone if you want to see their pages. Is it a surprise that Google shoved a technology to fix web on their platform down developers throats?Nothing else before AMP helped. Why do you think those developers will suddenly wake up and start building lightweight web pages now? Instead of ad bloated, video playing monstrosities?Web developers were slothful.

This gets launched much faster than one would have expected. And suddenly everyone pretends that the AMP cache URLs were never a problem and this is some kind of a power-grab."	jsnell	2.5117476	5.883568	comment	17.0	98.0	1555494263	-10.109126
