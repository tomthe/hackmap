In 1947, the Jews were 33% of the population and owned just 6% of the land of Palestine, yet a UN of only 46 countries and dominated by the great powers granted them 55% of the land for a Jewish state which zionist offensives quickly expanded to 80% of the land while ethnically cleansing the population.
The zionists were the direct cause of the exodus of the worlds' oldest Jewish communities in the other Arab lands both by their treatment of the Palestinians but also by sowing panic in Jews in Iraq and elsewhere by planting bombs in synagogues. 
Israel, a European colony largely, now needed Mizrahi Jews since the European Jews had been subjected to genocide.

22514679	> Serious question- how do you class	"> Serious question- how do you classify Israel as an ally?Number of reasons:1) History. Us Germans tried to exterminate all Jews (and thank God we failed), while the USA and Great Britain, the colonial power of Palestine, fought against Germany. It made sense that after WW2, Israel was founded as a ""safe haven"" for Jewish life, backed by USA/UK.2) Israel is the only real democracy in the entire region. Yes, Netanyahu has attacked democratic institution and basic democratic decency, but still: Israel is and likely will remain a democracy, a democracy allied to the US right in the region where the biggest oil reserves are.3) While Israel does have their own weapons program, they are a good customer of US arms. Some of their budget is actually paid by US Congress, but well, as long as the end"	mschuster91	14.686593	3.0879369	comment	3.0	10.0	1583620189	-8.540699

Also, probably they don't want to take on care and feeding of millions, and to simultaneously relieve Israel, their enemy, of that burden.	wolverine876	14.71249	3.0963492	comment	3.0	17.0	1702075697	-8.646528

These regimes can’t be bought with money, because some of them like Saudi Arabia and UAE have plenty of money. Israel needs friends and this is a great way to start and maintain friendships - provide a way for these tinpot dictators to cement their power. Sure, some people might be annoyed they were spied on but the news cycle will move on soon, while Saudi and UAE will remain staunch allies.

Israel has mandatory conscription that is rather difficult to get out of, and given their precarious situation in the Middle East I'm not entirely sure I'd blame them. As a result, the entire country spends their lives between the ages of 18-20 working in the military in some capacity, meaning that you can very easily make a case of 'military links' for any industry.

It encompassed the Philistines' five city states - Philistia - in southern Palestine (this comes from the Bible, I think it is unknown how many Philistine city states existed), but may also have encompassed a region larger than that. Since Palaistine referred to most of Palestine one can speculate that Peleset/Pilistu also did.Another theory is that Palestine came to be known as Palaistine after the Philistines via ""pars pro toto"", which means that a part becomes the name of the whole.

They suffer regular rocket and terror attacks to this day.It's also hard to blame all aggression in the region on the Israeli (Jews) when we recall that they were attacked by all neighboring nations as soon as they tried to find refuge in Israel, before there was any history of hostility.Simply put: Israel's neighbors targeted it for destruction from day 0.

That you see this ""argument"" so often only speaks to the effectiveness of a decades-long PR campaign, and not any reality.Does Israel have enemies? Plenty, and justifiably so in many cases! But enemies and existential threats are not the same thing. There is no existential threat to Israel, certainly not any in the form of a foreign aggressor. Anyone even considering becoming a serious existential threat to Israel has to contend with the reality of attempting to get rid of it militarily, "	maybelsyrup	14.70173	3.093397	comment	4.0	18.0	1615338705	5.4882035

In the same way its not clear all Americans understand the nuance of US Supreme Court influence (not as great as many think), its similarly unclear the Israeli electorate appreciates how unique its Court's authority is.

Iran recently attacked an Israeli ship, but more importantly it continues to arm terrorist groups (note I am Israeli, so I am probably not objective here, but yes I believe Hamas and Hezbollah are terrorist groups. Some of you may think differently on that. We can agree to disagree) that are against Israel’s existence.  Those groups are constantly either attacking or trying to attack Israel.Now you can argue Israel is also attacking those groups and you wouldn’t be wrong.  It’s almost impossible to figure out who started each round.  We only ever hear a very small part of the story.It is a circle of violence that will hopefully one day end.	benja123	14.665673	3.0970333	comment	5.0	39.0	1618159909	5.4704423

This doesn't mean they always tell the truth, but there is no equivalence between them and Hamas.In terms of specific reasons to doubt the Gaza Health Ministry numbers specifically, I could go on forever about that, but I don't see the point of doing so on HN.

Furthermore, Israel has been greatly outspoken in its hatred of Iran and Iran's nuclear program, going so far as to deploy the most sophisticated cyberattack in history[1]. It would hardly be a conspiracy theory to pin this on Israel rather than women suddenly waking up and deciding to riot after thousands of years of oppression.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet	jimbob45	14.640115	3.0483525	comment	5.0	29.0	1663864288	-12.668791

In the mid-90s I returned from living in the middle east for 6 months as a student (Jordan, Israel and Egypt). I personally witnessed an event and upon returning I was reading about said event in a US newspaper and was shocked at how wrong it was. This was the first time I experienced this effect. However, instead of turning to other parts of the paper and trusting what they said, I lost all faith in newspapers on that day and have not read one since. If I know they lied or, more generously, misunderstood what happened about something I know personally about, how can I ever trust anything they write about things I don't know about personally?

Anti-semitism has been awful throughout history, of course, particularly in Eastern Europe, which is a big part of what fueled the Zionists to resettle in Palestine, but locally the tensions started then, and increased significantly when Britain stepped in after WWI, and then when the UN created Israel in 1948, and so on.[0] https://chat.openai.com/c/83abf663-6011-4ed0-9a8b-f183d2e029...Edit: why the downvotes with no explanation?

30639480	This is how the Middle East works by	"This is how the Middle East works by the way. Interreligious marriages are a very big deal and banned in every single Middle Eastern country.The good countries will refuse to issue a marriage license to you, the bad countries will send the police to watch as a mob lynches you.If you see Israel as some kind of psuedo-western state, then yea, you should be shocked. But as a Middle Eastern country, this is just another Thursday. Personally, I don't see Israel any different than I see Turkey, Egypt, or Jordan.(Allies that get lots of money from the US with questionable behavior)edit: I think is wrong by the way, so not justifying. This is just how things work in the Middle East - where nations do terrible things in the name of preserving their ""religious"" identity.edit x2: Sources:
