For me, clear sign of this is how he's hated by the western media.Bad Russian leaders are loved by western media (e.g. Gorbachev, Yeltsin) and good ones are hated.	anticodon	6.3079166	2.7605913	comment	3.0	31.0	1618304243	8.433122

While some Rusyns did maintain the ethnonym, other Rusyn speakers have preferred to identify with another ethnonym instead. If East Slavs other than Russians and Belarussians did not stand up for the ethnonym en masse, no surprise that peoples elsewhere no longer have the ability to distinguish.

A hard drop on concrete could crack it.I'd also argue without a MA (metal analysis or labsheet) you probably bought some tungsten.  Lead, slag, tin and other undesirable byproducts also weigh a lot.  Your cube, without proper inspection, may also be slightly radioactive as its likely sourced from scrap.

There is literally no better way to make non-alignment a popular political stance.

Imagine if the US lost the cold war and the USSR decided to invite Canada and Mexico into the Warsaw Pact - that's pretty much what is going on here.The propaganda machine is in full swing at this point, I think the rulers of the US are actively hoping for war. Why else would they be so provocative?

If no one else is stepping up, then we should. That's about it.Letting Iran's nuclear program complete would seem like a major mistake. Letting North Korea's nuclear program progress + their space / ICBM program progress is also a mistake IMO. Etc. etc.	dragontamer	6.1647305	2.8823102	comment	3.0	14.0	1642113347	8.374327

I live in Berlin so all of that is basically at least partially dependent on Russian gas. It's winter here; so I'd prefer that not to happen. The EU is not prepared for a gas shutdown. Reserves are already low and a gas shutdown would be problematic. And it is still winter. Maybe in a few years it would be possible for the EU to do this without taking a huge hit on its power infrastructure and economy. But right now, it simply can't. Russia knows this and is clearly not taking this very serious. Mutually assured economic destruction is ultimately not going to be a serious option that politicians will entertain for very long.	jillesvangurp	6.3079176	3.0796084	comment	3.0	12.0	1645484477	8.333035

Many Germany have friendships with people from Ukraine. I myself have several in my wider social circle.There is also the European perspective. The cornerstone of European piece policy has been the integrity of state borders. This is now violated, so this is of very grave concern.Putin himself stated yesterday, that he considers the Ukraine a part of Russia, so there is concern that he won't stop anytime soon, unless stopped. Ironically, an occupation of the Ukraine makes him what he claimed to try to prevent - a direct neighbor to the NATO states. We can only hope he stops before attacking NATO.	_ph_	6.1839542	2.9286764	comment	3.0	13.0	1645537183	8.467708

I'm not going to get into much details, and I feel I will be downvoted  no matter how I try to reason Putin's behavior, but there are clear reasons behind it.

The invasion of Iraq was, as far as I understand it, based on outright lies from the Bush administration about evidence of nuclear weapons in Iraq. Just say, yeah, the invasion of Iraq was fucked up. This invasion of Ukraine is also fucked up. We should condemn both.There are probably nuanced arguments to be made about which is worse. You could maybe argue that attacking a NATO-aligned country is more dangerous for world peace than attacking Iraq was (at least from a western perspective). You could point to the fact that there's no reason to believe Putin will stop after Ukraine if that attack goes well; his ""excuse"" for invading Ukraine applies to most former Soviet countries."	mort96	6.1807823	2.8691118	comment	3.0	10.0	1645781249	8.48237

They have a knock-off debit card system [0], dedicated Internet censorship agency [1], and have been expelling Western civic organizations and trying to ban various European goods (e.g. french cheese).This absolutely does reduce the life quality of an average Russian, but it is done in a slow controlled way, and spun the right way with massive propaganda, so people don't call out bullshit.

The western media even used footage of Ukraine soldiers committing crimes of war, branding them as Russian soldiers, in the general indifference.You have to understand, that as of now the western media have entered the war propaganda mode. If you want to inform yourself neutrally you can't trust anyone media alone.I watch the Russia Today (RT) streams on YouTube. It's good to have a differing point of view. I don't take everything they say as granted, neither I so that with western media.

It's the 21st century, Western Europe has its own problems, barely any army and Russia has nuclear weapons capable of wiping out humankind from the earth. It's real life, not some Paradox Interactive game. I mean, even in times when such invasion could have made more sense, Napoleon's France and Nazi Germany tried, and they both failed miserably.

One of the following must be true:1) They do not believe they can, so are not trying.2) They believe they could, but are choosing not to.3) They tried, but, for some reason that's not currently clear and isn't evident in battlefield losses, failed.

From Libya(Reagan), Gulf War I, Serbia, Gulf War II, Afghanistan, Libya (Obama), the US has been fighting quite a bit.Whenever you are actually fighting an enemy, there is a learning curve. The big question is whether the sanctions and international isolation combined with the Ukrainian resistance will force Russia to back down, before they navigate that.

Everyone seems to agree Putin isn't really democratically elected (though are vague on the details of how he rigs this, beyond controlling TV channels), at the same time, somehow he's a dictator only because ordinary Russians just can't be bothered getting rid of him. This is a contradiction. Dictators stay in power even if almost everyone in a country wants to get rid of them because they have set things up that way.

If Latvia is attacked and the NATO doesn’t fight for them NATO stops being a thing immediately. The 5th article is a cornerstone of the whole aliance. It is not an optional “and one more thing” but the reason to join the aliance at all, if it becomes shaky that undermines the whole thing.I wouldn’t dare to guess what goes on in Putin’s mind, but I also don’t see any reason why he would think that.	krisoft	6.139306	2.913167	comment	3.0	13.0	1646342652	8.502777

For me there are two outcomes to target with the sanctions:* Make life unpleasant enough for the oligarchs that they replace Putin with someone less intent on ruining the nice thing they had going.* Handicap Russia's ability to wage war. This includes eliminating their ability to buy supplies and destroying their morale.It's the second goal that is, in my mind, the motivation for the economy-destroying sanctions.	lolinder	6.3026466	2.8719573	comment	3.0	26.0	1646498400	8.417683

Russians are not helpless. The main argument when this gets brought up seems to be that it's going to be hard and people will get hurt. Of course Putin isn't going to just throw up his hands and say ""Ok guys, you win, I'm out"". Nobody is expecting that. But we've seen that change is possible, and if the Russians are as against Putin's regime as some like to claim they are (with some even saying it's _most_ Russians), maybe it's time to actually do something about it.

While they have made some absolutely embarrassing mistakes, they are fielding the largest army seen in a generation, and still conducting offensive operations.Not even the US has put 13 divisions into a theater since....Vietnam?

After a hangar got bombed by cruise/ballistic missiles they would print a 1:1 aerial/satellite picture of the rubble, hang it over the actual rubble and then clean up under the print. It took quite a few weeks for the Russians to understand this ruse.The doctrine of always having air superiority in NATO (and thus not needing makeshift runways) is so far rather justified given the hilarious level of incompetence shown by the VKS. Although the RAF seems to be more anxious about it, they definitely know much more than me.

America doesn't want to go to war with Russia because we know it could be incredibly destructive, given that they have nukes. So, it would probably take a lot to start a war between the US and Russia. They would have to attack or be clearly planning to attack a NATO ally.It's possible that even if Russia intentionally downed a US jet, it would not immediately trigger a war. The US would likely add more sanctions, but they would probably show incredible restraint as well.	snek_case	6.1914263	2.8500054	comment	3.0	12.0	1704002629	8.4452915

It can come from the South Pole if it would cost the same or maybe 5-10% more, but not 400% more.Or, as I think it would have been even better, have citizens vote independently with their wallets. I for example, don't buy Turkish products because I think Erdogan is a-hole and a dictator. But I don't have a problem with other people buying Turkish products. So you could pass a law where citizens would have the option do deny consuming Russian gas and opt for Caspian Sea natural gas, or LNG from Qatar or whatever and pay the appropriate price. Providers would sell them gas from their preferred source and everyone would be happy.	ExoticPearTree	6.3145165	3.0601683	comment	3.0	10.0	1708001939	8.422827

The Red Army would expend vast amounts of blood and armor for small gains in WW2 (which worked, by the way, the 3rd Reich’s advance was stopped by a self-sacrificing bulwark of peasant soldiers). Before that, the Russian Empire would also often suffer massive casualties even in victory.The tone of the article is almost one of ‘what do you want from us, we blew up a lot of troops, but they just keep coming.

An aspect of the Ukraine war I'm still having trouble wrapping my mind around is how close (geographically) everything is.

It returned at 40% capacity for a while, before being slowed to 20% capacity in late July, and then shut off again at the end of August. So Nordstream 1 has only been not moving for a little less than a month at the time of the explosion.While I think accidental failure of the Nordstream pipeline is an underrated explanation, such a glaring factual inaccuracy makes me skeptical of the viability of the specific theory espoused in this article.	jcranmer	6.274823	3.1173053	comment	3.0	11.0	1664547185	8.410047

They showed me the warehouse full of really fancy robotic stuff (all made in Utah, and they were correct to be proud of it). We got to work looking over the code of the app, and along the way they learn that I am originally from USSR/Russia. ""Oh"" the devs say, ""do you want to see our Russia module""? I am of course intrigued, and discover that during the process of organization of 2002 SLC winter Olympics (Mitt Romney's baby/rise to prominence), there was"	danielodievich	6.322115	2.6716747	comment	3.0	43.0	1683152161	8.334193

But the book, “The End of the Regime: How Three European Dictatorships Ended”, is not about Russia or Vladimir Putin. It’s about three dictatorships — those of Francisco Franco in Spain, Antonio Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece — and how those countries became democracies, returning to the global fold. A large number of Russians haven’t suddenly taken an interest in the history of 20th-century Southern Europe. Rather, discussions of the book have common themes: How do prolonged right-wing dictatorships end? And can Russia become a democracy?	cs702	6.2911057	2.7802143	comment	3.0	30.0	1683473753	8.375161

Nuclear weapons are for USA, China, Russia, and maybe France/Europe, because they are not going to use it.

I don't fault him either, but the United States is - for now - not a party to this conflict and if they are not willing to guarantee a cease fire they have no place at the table. It has already been proven that any treaty with Russia regarding Ukraine is worth zilch so without a very large stick to back it up there is no point to even go there.Also, I think the analogy of Mexico joining China is way off base, and an overly simplistic view of everyday reality in Europe.	jacquesm	6.2319107	2.6925704	comment	3.0	11.0	1647991934	-12.337094

I saw it in Putin's speeches, and a recent RT clip -- this notion that what the US did to Iraq in 2003 justifies actions in Ukraine. As an American who was very opposed to the second Iraq war I find this false justification very disappointing. Firstly, that one bad action does not justify another. Second, the story that the US tells about itself is that we sometimes make mistakes, then our political process tries its best to correct them as time goes on. See also: slavery.

Rather, it's because the Russians are invading with 3x fewer soldiers than the Ukrainians have deployed, so they need every soldier they can in the South, now that the southern cauldron has been formed and Mariupol is on the verge of being taken.The fact that they have just recently been able to form the cauldron lends some credence to this theory. Now, the Russians will have to push the sides of the cauldron, which will necessitate a much higher amount of troops. If they succeed, the payoff is immense - the 100k+ troops of the Eastern front will have to retreat without mechanisation, making a fighting retreat impossible.

There's broad consensus that, if all of the storage infrastructure were topped up, Germany would be able to make it through _next_ winter reasonably well, even if Russia stopped delivering gas. However, currently the storage capacity is at around 30%, which is insufficient.

But it also creates frankensteins like the BMPT [1] which is an IFV built on top a widely available T-72 tank platform but costs 2-4x what a normal IFV/BMP costs [2] and lacks the benefits of either an IFV or main battle tank.Ultimately it has little to do with the inh"	dmix	6.0666223	2.4472466	comment	3.0	13.0	1675149417	6.3605924

The risk of not being able to properly maintain them down the line and ending up with 3-4 operable planes is too high for the advantages of stealth (which IMO comes more into play when on the offence, which Finland probably won't be anytime soon).Agree about Ukraine too. Sending highly sophisticated jets that will take months to learn is wasting Ukraine's time - Gripens, maybe Mirage 2000s, MiG-29s make the most sense.	sofixa	5.8995895	2.4341266	comment	3.0	17.0	1675248569	6.1332874

(This also might involve Wagner going to Belarus, not to escape Russia after the coup attempt, but in order to do a job for Russia.)  But what's the point?  Belarus isn't going to conquer Poland.  Russia's not going to conquer the Baltics.  So what's going on?If this is all a master plan, I think it's most likely that Putin is trying to create a war (or at least a real threat of war) with NATO,	AnimalMuppet	6.2118726	2.8454747	comment	3.0	13.0	1691066742	8.46476

The US retaliated with a blockade.Moving NATO to the doorstep of Russia is analogous.  Not surprisingly, the Russians retaliated with force.Of course Putin is a corrupt thug, but you don't go poking a bear with a stick and then complain when he slashes you with his claws.	alejohausner	6.170801	2.8727398	comment	3.0	18.0	1691647402	8.390663

Calling the invasion a ""special military operation"" shows how it was thought of as a special operation by intelligence services instead of conventional war.But Zelenskiy responded with ""I need ammo, not a ride"", and instead of unarmed protesters, Russian riot police convoys driving into Ukraine were met by Armed Forces of Ukraine.[1][1] https://www.youtube.co"	mopsi	6.216251	2.7975407	comment	3.0	33.0	1678473596	8.442653

They will however use that retreat to acquire modern technology and improve their economy so they can ultimately conquer the west.Only one analyst, J.R Nyquist has been taking this stuff seriously, and he was ignored.

So when it is time for the institutions to do their job they find that they are a shell of their former self.India also has major corruption problems that bode ill for it in future conflicts.

From Prigozhin's position, this means to step back after becoming an existential threat and try to co-live peacefully.

Putin's underlings would probably fall in behind him if they believed he did.Putin, for all his personal power, is only one guy, he depends on the loyalty of the people around him, and this being  russia, I imagine they're very much looking out for themselves, rather than some higher calling, so they can be convinced of what's good for them in the current situation.	dkjaudyeqooe	6.2532926	2.7575822	comment	3.0	19.0	1687643617	8.549878

The only reason for blowing up the dam would be to stop Ukraine forces at that flank, however the Russians were in control of the dam and they could have just opened it.

31299062	“Panzer” in a very general protectiv	“Panzer” in a very general protective sense translates to “Armour”. Brustpanzer -> Chest armour. Even a turtle’s shell is a Panzer. Typically a hard enclosure protecting the main body of a thing. But not its extremities. A “helmet” is a “Helm”. Though any element can be “gepanzert”, or “armoured”.It is important to note that Panzer mostly refers to protection from violence.

I learned about Russian culture during the Cold War, from professors who were Soviet emigres and the children of emigres. The image of Russian sensibilities I developed from their stories of everyday life in Russia was rather different from the brutish stereotype in popular culture, at the same time more empathetic but also scarier. Since then, I have always been disturbed by the dehumanizing portrayal of Russians in the West. Now with the war in Ukraine, that popular tendency has exploded into a vicious mania. Russia is full of people who love their family and are just trying to get through life. If 80% support Putin even with all that is going on, something is going on with them that Westerners clearly don't appreciate.	wrp	6.328048	2.7367134	comment	3.0	12.0	1652095956	8.401951

There's also Sumykhimprom plant in Sumy, that's right on the border with russia. The plant is intact, but I think it's not working as well due to war.If we chase russians off from Ukraine, food prices will return to normal"	code123456789	6.1983867	2.9090319	comment	3.0	26.0	1653839517	8.407082

I think it's less a question of if Ukraine wins or loses in whatever this is, and more of how are we going to re-equilibrate? To something stable, or to some fragile ongoing steady-state?

The main tactical problem with that is that those forces don't have standoff distance from Russian A2AD weapons.The underlying causes of these changes are Germany (1) continuing to spend less than 2% of GDP on defense; (2) its 2019 announcement that its pushing back its 2% target date from 2024 (agreed upon in 2015) to 2031; and, (3) continued German support for Nord Stream 2.America is publicly penalizing Germany for the above reasons, which will likely disincent	HenryKissinger	6.1858025	2.8734264	comment	3.0	14.0	1596206822	8.404195

Had the war ended in two weeks, as it looked like it was going to right at the start, he would have met his domestic goals.But then it turned out that Ukraine was more prepared than Russian intelligence thought, and Europe started flooding it with weapons. Given that Russia isn't taking the war half as seriously[1] as Ukraine is, none of what's happening is irrational or surprising.[1] By design. Putin didn't want an existential conflict that required actual sacrifice on the part of his constituents, he just wanted an easy victory to cement his popularity. He's now stuck in a situation where he has few good options.	vkou	6.2009706	2.8517792	comment	4.0	20.0	1664929815	8.463578

In other words, pipeline or not, Russia won't be selling gas to Germany anytime soon, so there's really not a lot of downside to blowing up a useless pipeline. And it's easy to deny too, as you and others point out: why would Russia blow up their own pipeline?Here's why: the upside for Russia is getting European NATO countries to point fingers at each other, accusing Poland or USA or Great Britain of (nearly) violating Denmark's territorial integrity.

They could ruin the world simply by continuing to use their fossil fuels without regard to climate change.They could nuke themselves.They could conduct a few missile tests in space and precipitate a Kessler syndrome situation.They could trade nuclear secrets for more kamikazi drones.Do you see where I'm going?If you want Russia destroyed they you are asking for a world war.

The huge engines required so much fuel that the MiG was surprisingly short-ranged.

Its task was to intercept nuclear bombers flying over Soviet Union and it did this task pretty well.Because it used steel it was cheap and easy to service. At that time soviets had lot of experience with titanium (space, submarines), but expensive plane similar to SR-71 would not cover entire Soviet Union.	jkot	6.013158	2.3578389	comment	4.0	24.0	1473257059	6.0272994

I understand the nervousness of Ukraine, but not of the US. If Russia invades, then by all means, the West can destroy it economically; but until it does, what is the point of all this saber-rattling?Just as I don't understand the point of NATO's eastwards expansion, which, in turn, makes the Russians nervous. If the European countries are worried by the military buildup along Russia's western border, surely it must be easy to empathise with the Russian worry about Nato including more Eastern European countries and being able to deploy missiles there, which can be used both defensively an	azangru	6.1766844	2.895771	comment	4.0	27.0	1643026284	8.501586

Or at least, disabled a large enough fraction that the counterattack was survivable.This was seen as winning. Or as close to winning as you can get, in a nuclear war.

The sheer cost of getting bogged down in an insurgency he couldnt possibly win suggests he's going to take an option which plays to his strengths instead.More likely he will try to cleave off strategically important territory with Russian majorities (forming a land bridge to crimea, maybe all the way to transnistria) and leave Kyiv having extracted a promise to remain unarmed, ""neutral"" and providing no aid to insurgencies or face another bloody assault."	pydry	6.121167	2.9059668	comment	4.0	22.0	1645778341	8.502753

Will the rest of NATO really risk a nuclear war if Russia decides to invade one of Latvia/Lithuania/Montenegro/Estonia? As recently as last year, the US had an anti-NATO President. This could happen again in the near future. If it does, Putin will be emboldened to continue expanding Russia's sphere of influence."	axg11	6.1484933	2.9288404	comment	4.0	20.0	1645808144	8.5161

If ukraine joins NATO it becomes untouchable, even for putin, hence why they were willing to support the donbass rebels and escalate to a war now. If putin was just going for the easiest target and didn't mind NATO, ukraine is hardly the weakest target in the area.Once you attack a NATO member you are almost automatically at war with all the members of the alliance and you'll probably have to face already present nato troops as soon as the war starts.	mardifoufs	6.119393	2.9451551	comment	4.0	13.0	1645809775	8.485709

Putin ostensibly should have no reason to fear NATO expansion unless he has ill intent.And if the argument is: yes, it is defensive now, but it might turn offensive against Russia at some point. Well, for that you just need an alliance of countries, it does not need to be NATO. A group of countries comprised of NATO and non-NATO members can gang up against Russia any time they want, without any NATO involvement.I believe Putin only says this because he wants to keep invading other countries on the table as an option, and that is precisely the reason to keep expanding NATO.

All it would take is a humanitarian incident such as the extended siege of a city. The calls for military action would be ferocious.

I.e. in extractive industries they have close to none, in manufacturing they have a solid measure of respect, while in tech industries they get to dictate the culture of the company.Which means a mob leadership (we're not pretending anymore Russia doesn't have one of those, right?) will favor extractive industries over everything else, not just because they're much easier to own and exploit, but because allowing other types of companies to grow creates power centers outside of their control.

You would want sandbags or steel plating on the cage, so that it works properly.The idea is that it reduces the effectiveness of two stage anti-tank weapons.  Where the weapon first has a sacrificial payload that gets any reactive armor to explode...then the real payload to penetrate the normal armor.  The cage is supposed to get the first, sacrificial, payload to explode without setting off the reactive armor.They do supposedly work (at least some reduced effectiveness of the weapon, in some way) if they are done right.  That is, that they are wide enough to cover the incoming attack angle of the anti-tank weapon...and dense enough to keep the reactive armor from going off on the first payload.	tyingq	6.0666885	2.4543514	comment	4.0	19.0	1647350198	6.259978

It’s not really about saving Ukrainian lives. It’s actually far from obvious that prolonging the war saves lives. But most of the EU has taken a very Atlantist position on this conflict and at this point it’s probably better to keep going and significantly neuter Russia.

No, Biden did not authorize a clandestine attack on Russian infrastructure just to boost the US auto industry, nor did he subtly broadcast his nefarious intent months ago as part of some game to throw red meat to the conspiratorialists, Q-style. The US would have nothing to gain and everything to lose by engaging in such an action, and has absolutely no impetus to since it already currently has the upper hand in the overall geopolitical conflict. The pipeline can be repaired within months, and the sanctions were already going to last for at least that long.

Moreover I've been reading that the pipes were empty anyway. Do they keep those pipe pressurized all the time?Whoever did it most likely used an explosive by my estimation.

If they were to already assume that there's no way the EU will give in to the gas blackmail this winter, blowing up the pipeline and sowing doubt on the US or Ukraine itself being behind it could be a way to divide support for Ukraine.

There have been at least three invasions and occupations that are significantly worse crimes: the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, and the Saudi-led invasion of Yemen.

This means that Russia can't sell at full price because even those not enforcing the cap aren't willing to pay full price for it (why should they, when Russia's choices of customers are severely limited?).

How can we stop the murdering Russian/Saudi/Talian regimes if their people can't seem to find the power to do it themselves?Edit: lol, messed up the distances. Kiew to Berlin is pretty much Rome to Berlin.

We know Russia has weapons in far greater depth and can outlast and wear Ukraine down - unless saner minds prevail.

And yet, Russia keeps shooting them.The truth is Putin's Kremlin is to blame for this wide-spread shortage and upcoming famine in many regions of the World, the West should just take the funds they seized as seed money to grow wheat in Africa this season even if it's a loss to offset this massive lost in cultivation in Ukraine.For what it's worth, planting is still taking place [0], it's just being disrupted and will not be as large	Melting_Harps	6.1723275	2.893246	comment	4.0	22.0	1653168167	8.492566
31466454	The other aspect of the Ukraine war 	The other aspect of the Ukraine war used for advocating for nuclear, which the nuclear proponents like to omit is that 25% of European uranium comes from Russia, so Europe's dependence on Russia is even stronger for Uranium than for gas. It's simply dishonest to use the current situation as an argument for nuclear. If anything it shows that we should have invested into renewables much more strongly, but nuclear proponents were strongly arguing against it because it would have made nuclear even less financially viable.	cycomanic	6.1699085	2.9038312	comment	4.0	46.0	1653212915	8.430083

This does correlate with the color of his passport but it's just that — a correlation. His actions speak louder than words.

If they're wrong, they're just wrong aren't they?As to clues, there are plenty. Biden proclaiming that he would put an end to Nord Stream 2 is a clue. That no one seems to be in a big rush to find out who did it given the scale of this and that it destroyed important infrastructure of a NATO member is a clue.

Currently Russia produces more ammo than all NATO countries combined. Ukraine allies need to open new assembly lines for ammo production, as a successful attack on the pretty well prepared Russian defences will take a ton of artillery shells.Looks like Russia mobilized over half a million soldiers so far (while officially stating 300K). Their military factories are working on 3 shifts 24/7. When they produce enough equipment and weapons no doubt they'll do a new wave of mobilization. Long term Russia can mobilize more soldiers than Ukraine, so NATO has to compensate by supplying Ukraine with big amount of artillery, tanks, fuel, equipment and most importantly ammo.

The motivation absolutely matters - US Imperialism is much softer, even in it's war crimes, than Russian Imperialism that comes with genocide bundled. In the former case where it hurts is that they try to paint a rosy picture (freedom and democracy etc.) while committing war crimes / invading left and right for business interests, and that hypocrisy is very annoying. At the same time when the Russians invade, they're brutal, war crimes are part of their process. I'd take the former over the latter any day, even ideally neither should be a thing in the 2020s.	sofixa	6.246722	2.845589	comment	5.0	24.0	1679411991	8.423669

The changes are not enough to form “a new identity”... I think.Also, one thing that Russian powers-that-be absolutely cannot stand is separatism.

Before the EU and the drive to economic integration, Europe had been in a state of almost perpetual war between the different states. Even today the economic integration has made war between most European states unthinkable. Nobody is worried about the U.K. declaring war on France or vice-versa, something that almost habitual before the 21st century.Russia is the anomaly here, the one case where economic integration didn’t prevent war. But just because the approach isn’t 100% effective, doesn’t mean it’s worthless.	avianlyric	6.245999	2.9308293	comment	5.0	22.0	1651657337	8.408241

It's been known since the Spanish Civil War that tanks are vulnerable to anti-tank teams when not properly supported by infantry, especially in adverse terrain. WW2-era tanks were effectively countered by anti-tank gun teams in entrenched positions, which is why they worked in concert with infantry, artillery, and close air support to suppress anti-tank guns and enable the tanks to advance.

This is much more difficult to do without the support of congress because the support has to be indirect — the funding has to be off-the-books — because this was a violation of the Minsk agreement.Since 2022, the floodgates have opened and the US is now openly  sending money and weapons systems, now totaling over $100B since the Russian invasion.

Governments do slowly learn the lessons of the past and are hesitant to give out too many weapons.- Mobilization in Russia has seen hundreds of thousands flee the country and tens of thousands of young men have been killed or wounded.

It had developed textile industry, built heavy carriers, tractors.Sure, they needed innovations, market thinking, and transparent controlled privatization, but there were hope and enthusiasm in the beginning of 1990s.My opinion, Russian influence killed it eventually - they helped Lukashenko to stay in power in 1996 and made the country dependent on Russian markets, oil, gas, money - and Lukashenko spent all the money on economically ineffective government projects, lost investors, kept inefficient model.

They've got armed drones from Turkey, Javelins from the US/UK, the freaking EU of all organizations is saying they'll send them fighter jets.  Even Germany is sending weapons.Combine that with the apparent intense Ukrainian morale and Russian military incompetence/lack of will, Ukraine winning is not entirely out of the question.  Even if they lose they seem fully prepared to commit to an insurgency, which given said international support and direct borders with NATO would be the best equipped insurgency in history.Never mind the potential effects of the sanctions, which are truly massive in scope.Ukraine could very well be the rock that breaks Russia's teeth.	scottLobster	6.156441	2.8563144	comment	5.0	53.0	1645998783	8.469423

So, since he is still fighting, what is he fighting _for_? Still trying to expand Russia? But the Russia we knew is already not going to be the same as it once was.

Next, kinetic operations will likely begin with air and missile strikes against Ukraine’s air force and air defense systems. Once air superiority is established, Russian ground forces would move forward, slightly preceded by special operations to degrade further command and control capabilities and delay the mobilization of reserves by conducting bombings, assassinations, and sabotage operations.The Russian commandants were so sure about their chances that they didn't wait for air superiority.Or, they didn't want to be seen as an invader but a liberator and as we know that failed terribly.	bhaak	6.1580076	2.781523	comment	5.0	69.0	1646229709	8.380789
30527467	The Russian military seems to be ext	The Russian military seems to be extremely unmotivated, and rightly so. This is Putin's war. Nobody else wanted it. There is evidence that lower ranks in the Russian military don't want to kill their neighbors who mostly speak the same language. Morale is very low, as many cases of abandoned vehicles and surrender illustrate. Unfortunately, the longer a war goes on, the more both sides harden and the more brutal the war becomes.I wonder if it wouldn't help for the West to guarantee political asylum for Russian deserters, maybe even with a new identity for them. But I don't know if this is practically achievable, at least not without extensive vetting and not as long as they are PoWs.

Which is tantamount to a direct attack on NATO.Finally, Sweden has several bi-lateral defence agreements with countries like the UK and US. It's obviously not technically the same as being a NATO member, but many people in the Swedish defence establishment regard it as closely equivalent.

The Russians are not exactly offering a tour de force in optimal support of their heavy armor. I will take their user error in favor of the good guys but don’t want to draw a broader lesson about the utility of the tank quite yet.120mm cannon rounds are cheaper and more plentiful than guided missiles, which means a lot.That said, it’s getting harder and harder to understand a scenario in which tanks can be employed successfully against a motivated, competent defender with plentiful ATGM and loitering munition stocks.	sklargh	6.084243	2.4921165	comment	5.0	24.0	1647444035	6.3691173

36669515	Ukraine is piss poor compared to Rus	Ukraine is piss poor compared to Russia. For years Russia provided Ukraine with underpriced gas while Ukraine’s export prices increased rapidly, but due to the dysfunctional governments they had, they never were able to take advantage of that. Ukraine historically was an agrarian economy that was industrialized with the usual Soviet brutality, accompanied by agriculture collectivization and the usual mass repression. After the fall of the Soviet Union, it inherited a relatively good infrastructure and capital stocks, especially in energy, but it mostly failed to maintain that. Add to that the fact that since 1992, there was only one year when Ukraine had a balanced budget. There was a lot of growth in the aughts due to the high price of metallurgical during this decade, but Ukraine was mos	elzbardico	6.1937184	2.846983	comment	5.0	16.0	1689009507	8.398503

Yet when I asked her about Ukraine, she repeated all the standard Russian government propaganda about an alleged NATO threat and stated that she was ""neutral"" on whether Russia should invade Ukraine.

As long as you don’t exceed the allowed number of breaks disabled, you’re fine.2. The slide just warns about possible adversary effects (off-axis skid and longer landing distance) if some of the breaks are disabled.

Patriots and NASAMs can not kill things they can't see--against aircraft flying a treetop level their engagement range is very short.  However, aircraft flying at treetop level are very vulnerable if they fly too close to a MANPAD launcher.  Flight time will be a few seconds and the desired engagement is from behind--about your only chance of beating it is automated flare dispensers or anti-missile lasers (blinding the seeker, not actually killing the missile.)  An aircraft that could fly home crippled from a marginal hit will still go in because the pilot has no altitude to trade for time.Ukraine isn't an edge case, Ukraine is what you would expect from anything less than a turkey shoot.

If Ukraine goes very well, this will be sooner. If Ukraine goes poorly but he still wins and installs a puppet government, it'll be on a longer time frame once he consolidates forces and adds the remnants of the Ukrainian and Moldovan militaries to the Russian and Belarusian ones.The reasoning here is pretty sound, and the more I think about it the more I come to believe that NATO should be fighting Russia right now - at least deny them air superiority.

The simple fact is that there is no real upside to risking actual war with Russia - that the Russians will dominate the Ukraine while walking away with a bloody nose (in the form of minor troop losses of its own) is a foregone conclusion. Without more, that's a localised conflict that Russia rather hilariously can try to claim the moral high ground about (NATO encroachment, historical alliances, American instability and foreign meddling), but if America or indeed any of the other nuclear powers gets involved, the risks increase massively very quickly.

Their banks accounts frozen in a crashing currency. Can't sell their homes. Can't take their elderly parents with them (healthcare).

Few other European states have any or all of these characteristics; UK and France probably come the closest, yet the idea of either of them emulating Russia seems rather implausible. In short, just because the strategy failed for Russia, doesn’t really disprove the strategy in general, given Russia is such a special case.	skissane	6.2529297	2.8656106	comment	6.0	53.0	1651649679	8.420751

  - some will disassemble on the intercept and won’t explode at all
  - some will fall to the ground and explode with variety level of force
  - some will fall and won’t explode at all

The problem is that in many cases, what we deem as irrational behavior is simply behavior predicated from different beliefs or different values. How Putin evaluates different outcomes for Russia is likely to be very different than that from a western context. Our strategy to avoid a nuclear war must be in light of our assessment of his beliefs and values, and an analysis of how he will maximize Russia's outcome from that perspective.If our policy is one of complete Russian retreat, and we reason from our context that escalating to nuclear weapons to secure victory is irrational, we're all but assuring an eventual nuclear 	hackinthebochs	6.1950965	2.870929	comment	6.0	98.0	1664656242	8.41085

That's an interesting world view.On the contrary, the existence of nuclear weapons makes significant conflicts between large nations less likely, as both fear nuclear escalation.Just a year ago, Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in a free-for-all melee at the border using nothing but sticks and stones. Both are nuclear states, and they feared an escalation to a proper armed conflict if actual weapons were involved. Pakistan and India, also both nuclear states, have a localized conflict in Kashmir that has been ongoing for decades. However, neither state dares to fully commit to a decisive military intervention there. If Russia didn't possess nuclear weapons, it's not unimaginable to think that the US would have intervened directly in Ukraine, maybe even with boots on the ground. 	clawoo	6.1774683	2.8817039	comment	7.0	31.0	1707215010	8.428275

Then they get orders to proceed into Ukraine, probably spun without any collateral information or lies. At this point under DDoS their usual news sources are GONE. That means no propaganda available from the Russian government. The only sources available to them, if they get access to them, are saying that they're the bad guys and that is soul crushingly demotivating when you don't know why you are where you are."	hughrr	6.2233	2.7409697	comment	7.0	55.0	1645896451	8.416989

The US and Russia could not even conquer Afghanistan - with a virtually non-existent army, and no allies to help Afghanistan.As Ukraine is showing - they have a strong, well organized military. Beside a lack of anti-bomber missiles (Patriots) - they have everything they need to defend themselves.They now have full support from almost the entire advanced world beside China and India. And it looks like they'll be getting some Patriot missiles within 24 hours.Russia doesn't even have partial support from anyone. The best they can get is China and India trying to stay neutral - and it looks like China is starting to side with the rest of the world, with reports it has blocked all banks from lending money to Russia.	onlyrealcuzzo	6.1346025	2.887311	comment	7.0	26.0	1645902712	8.420399

This was compounded by successive waves of expansion after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the entity NATO was supposedly created to defend against.Second, Zelensky seems out of his depth here (geopolitically) and should've realized this. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 should've raised the alarm bells here both that 	jmyeet	6.1658425	2.895288	comment	7.0	36.0	1645906223	8.491433

Had the initial plan of decapitating the government and installing a puppet who signs a peace agreement with Russia worked, I doubt we'd be seeing the same level of support as now. Apparently the EU is now giving them jets in addition to all the small arms, fuel and anti-tank weapons. With all the economic sanctions it seems like they want to collapse the Russian economy and instigate regime change from the inside. Putin made a risky bet by attacking Ukraine, but the EU collapsing Russia with all their nukes still hanging around and hoping the next government in charge is more stable is a way more risky bet.	monkeybutton	6.1602006	2.9021199	comment	7.0	56.0	1646001397	8.467989

He has been trusted completely since. “He is the glove that fits the American hand,” the source said.A lot of what he is saying here is not strictly true. Jens Stoltenberg was the leader of the labour party and while he was not a communist, describing him as a committed anti-communist is just plainly wrong. It was not part of his platform at all and one the parties in his coalition was a socialist, Marxist party.Also he was not a hardliner on Russia.

They also announced that they'd be stopping buying any Russian gas at all by 2023. So Russia demanded Europe pay for their gas in Roubles. Because why wouldn't they in those circumstances?

But frankly, those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.)- it is imperative to distinguish between the government and the people, in particular in very authoritarian regimes.

I'm Ukrainian/Armenian who grew up in Russia in the 80s, I had always assumed that the military would at least stay relevant when the economy isn't. It's just been the pride of the country for centuries and to some extent even ingrained in Russian DNA that I could not see that changing going forward. I had grandparents and uncles in the Soviet military and I saw the pride in them. Now we see the bottom completely fall out as it's become eroded by decades of preposterous corruption.

This is further severing of ties between Russia and NATO-aligned countries. I expect other former Soviet Union states to follow and also acquire U.S. aircraft.

Drastic. Catastrophic. Suicidal. World-changing.The country (Russia) in its current form has just ceased to exist. The entire parasitic elite class just got cut off from everything they stole during all these years. The entire human potential of Russia just got nullified for at lest 20 years. The push towards green energy (and I hope nuclear fusion) just got accelerated. NATO and EU memberships just became essential for any European country. The prospects of nuclear disarmamant are nullified.The war isn't exactly a blitzkrieg now, but it still has a good chance to succeed -- but that's not what matters. It's the consequences that matter.

After taking in so many refugees in recent history the EU is gunshy about another migration.	zer00eyz	6.167914	2.865225	comment	12.0	127.0	1708089496	8.472207

He argues that Russia invading Ukraine (and putting a pro-Russian government in its place), it is the same as USA invading Iraq. In his view, both of these invasions where motivated by own interests: Russia is motivated by their own interest to unite old Soviet Union again and USA was motivated to secure their resource interests (oil). How do you defend against this?I argued that both conflicts cannot be compared. USA was reactive (against the threat of 9-11), whereas Russia is proactive, invading an independent country with shallow arguments (Nato is a defense alliance that would never invade Russia, yet Putin calls Nato a threat).

There are several logical reasons if you understand Russian history, geography, psychology and demography.In terms of history, in the past 500 years, Russia has been invaded several times from the west.  Specifically, Moscow has been attacked and conquered six times in its history by foreign armies, and usually via the same routes.  This is also where geography plays an important role in understanding the Russian invasion.In terms of geography, the Carpathian Mountains are a natural land defence between the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea.

It's actually pretty hard to tell how the war is actually going for any side, given all the propaganda.But, Russia seems to be doing a lot of damage and holding at least some territory despite basically the entire world (except for Russia's apparent allies in this new Non-Western Axis, mostly China and Iran) providing historic amounts of military might.

And actually, officially joining NATO will have consequences, as Putin has lined out. We can't just go on ignoring that Putin exists and has demonstrated he is willing to follow through with his threats, especially when it comes to NATO expansion.

In other words, the country is using over 500% of its productive output on the war (a neat trick without any imports!)For reference, in 1940 the United States spent 1.64% of its GDP on defense.

The country has pledged to end the use of Russian gas by 2024, the Habeck said in a March 25 press release.Some in this thread have asked how Germany could be so foolish to tie its economic destiny to such a problematic country as Russia.The answer seems to be ""one step at a time."" And Germany is not unique.Take the United States, for example, and its near total dependency on Chinese manufacturing for, well, just about everything. The US offshored manufacturing capacity hand-over-fist. In exchange the US got cheap goods (and low inflation), and continued supremacy of the dollar in world trade and as a reserve asset.Both of those benefits are looking sh"	Barrera	6.341131	3.1252792	comment	14.0	108.0	1649166010	8.343536

The signature marine weapon is the Poseidon P8. This is a heavily modified Boeing 737 NG configured for maritime intelligence and attack. This is what sank the Moskva.If you read the analysis from intelligence reports, the Neptune is a rather unremarkable anti-surface missile with underwhelming capabilities. The Poseidon hovered hundreds of miles away and relayed the combat information to Ukraine commanders when the Moskva was weakened; and more than likely, when its short range defenses were down (likely due to Russian Incompetence). No doubt the Poseidon has watched every Russian Naval asset to figure out they were taking down de	exabrial	6.1194634	2.5174022	comment	14.0	160.0	1653319691	7.2894883

36461318	The most likely answer for what is g	The most likely answer for what is going on here is the one right on the surface.  Prigozhin realized that he could try to take Moscow, but he'd ultimately be defeated, Putin was already gone.  He acted without any political support and without having a bunch of aces up your sleeve an attempted coup is destined to fail.  It would also drag units away from Ukraine to deal with him and undermine Russian efforts in the face of the Ukrainian offensive.  Prigozhin is still fighting against Ukraine and probably recognized that he would go down in Russian history as a traitor.  It was very likely just a rash miscalculation by Prigozhin.  He's hoping to use this as political leverage now, but my guess would be that he winds up dead pretty soon.  I doubt there's any 4 dimensional chess going on.If 	lamontcg	6.2415643	2.7908056	comment	14.0	162.0	1687631085	8.484682

Also, I feel like a lot of the sanctions are targeting the Russian people as a whole, and because I do know some Russians I can see how tough the situation is turning on them... even though they are as innocent as any other civilian in this war.

30463888	Ukraine is not a NATO member, but Po	Ukraine is not a NATO member, but Poland is.  If Russia attacks a member of NATO then all members of NATO are obligated to join in defence militarily.  Russia can attack non-NATO countries and intimidate NATO into doing nothing, but to attack a NATO member would automatically bring the whole alliance into the war.  The whole point of alliances like NATO is to prevent countries from being picked off by a bully the way Ukraine now is.  Belarus, Finland, or any of Russia's other non-NATO neighbours are probably pretty nervous right now, but Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, etc. are much less likely to be attacked by Russia.Talk of Ukraine joining NATO may well have been what triggered this war.  Russia probably had plans to absorb Ukraine eventually, but if Ukraine had joined NATO it would have req	beloch	6.14329	2.910376	comment	16.0	153.0	1645765476	8.509815

They seem to be doing a pretty good job of destroying invading force so far, but what's next? They either run out of steam defending, or they start to hit back at Russia, but then Russia could just unload a few nukes on them and be done with it. The West seems intent on not getting involved, and if they won't risk conflict now due to mutually assured destruction, they won't risk it after Russia uses nukes on Ukraine either.

What happens in the other 100-X% case now they have nothing left to lose?Is the idea that we just say ""right, that's it, Russia is isolated forever now"" and there we are? e.g. ""we"" showed that trade doesn't work, so instead we go for a kind of indefinite containment strategy?It just feels like a really stupid path to go down in my view because once you eliminate interdependence via trade you've now removed another barrier to Russia just deciding to take another country.Sure, NATO, MAD and all of that - but all of that was already there anyway.Onc"	throwaway22032	6.2104216	2.8870506	comment	19.0	142.0	1646785891	8.477828

You won't mistake that for anything else, believe me.AA launch gone haywire for some reason is my bet. The small explosion is also telling (AA missiles have small warheads, they are all fuel).

Unlike government issued currencies, any monopoly or control facebook derives isn't done through force, it's by making a coin better than all the other coins.

This hurts their bargaining position in a big way because they've just lost their biggest source of leverage against Germany.Poland opened a new pipeline to Norway on the same day as the leaks appeared, so there was lots of Polish activity in the waters.Poland doesn't receive gas via Nordstream, so damaging it doesn't hurt them in any way.Poland is Ukraine's most ardent supporter in Europe, often leading the vanguard of actions to support Ukraine.

I find that completely baffling.For opportunity, consider that while setting up the pipeline needs a weird high-pressure residence and special training, blowing it up takes a fishing boat, scuba gear and underwater explosives. The equipment and training is cheap and available. So, those with opportunity is almost anyone. Practically, anyone with access to the Baltic Sea, boats, scuba equipment, underwater explosives; it doesn't have even to be anyone with military training, just skills in underwater demolition.For motivation, consider who benefits from permanently reducing European dependence on Russian energy?Resist going for ""Clearly, Russia!"".

It just seems so overwhelmingly bad, you have to wonder if actually the war is going ok for them despite all these things and the Western media is simply keen to point out their shortcomings.It just makes less and less sense with each story.	lordnacho	6.21752	2.7756238	comment	26.0	207.0	1652517826	8.4353695

With that caveat out of the way...It seems that the Russian soldiers are making efforts to avoid attacking civilians directly. Counterexamples exist and could be explained by rogue units, incompetence, or hot-blooded revenge on local resistance.I speculate that Russian airforce weaponry is not generally high-precision, and the order to avoid targeting civilians implies restraint on use of indiscriminate bombing. Again, we've seen counterexamples which could be explained by all of the above reasons, plus the possibility of friendly fire from failed Ukrainian air defences.I can only imagine that the ""pro-civil"	jl6	6.167663	2.7894354	comment	28.0	279.0	1646249170	8.429663
