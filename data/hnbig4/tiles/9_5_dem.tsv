I'm not a tutor intending to teach Kalman filters to anyone in the near future, fair, but I should have the mathematical background to get through this. Not sure why it feels like a slog.

They are best used when being wrong is a non issue or as a type of cache, but preforming a hash is generally really slow.  Also, the way virtual memory works looking up an answer often makes storing the new value much faster.So, while cool they have generally been replaced by far more useful and less complex topics.One example is if your looking for duplicates among huge data sets.  You farm out your Filter to 1,000 machines merge them, then re run to get a list of possible collisions.  Then compare that list.

This is very hard to do in general, but has an exact solution if your system is Linear-Gaussian. That's magical!* You can also think of it as a ""better way to average"".

I would add skip lists, not because they’re structurally anything special but because they open your mind to the possibly entirely-new-to-the-reader world of probabilistic data structures.As someone that’s been around the block, something I’ve learned to be less surprised by is how often simply adding an element of randomness to a difficult problem can sometimes give you results comparable to a 10- or 100-times more complicated solution, with the advantage of being more maintainable, making better use of the i$, and avoiding a lot of work.

1) It's for the BLOOM model which isn't great compared to somewhat recent gpts. Like I think I read that it's worse than the openai models on a per parameter basis.
2) It's faster than using RAM/SSD as faux VRAM but 'only' by 10x.
That was even before LLaMA or its improvements had existed for running locally. So by my old understanding, bloom/petals wouldn't be even as good as those ones even though it technically has more parameters.

Just use a simple incrementing salt value to modify the input so you can hash the resulting salted input as many times as you need to, using a different salt value each time.Say you want to hash the string ""abc"" 8 times. Instead of having 8 hash functions, just take the hash of, say, ""abc-0"", ""abc-1"", ... ""abc-7"". As long as your hash function is of good quality and you're treating the output properly, you don't have to worry about the results from these different inputs having some significant relationship. For cryptographic types maybe I'm using the term ""salt"" loosely. Whatever, think of another term if you like.

Two major advantages off the top of my head are the ability to track multi-modal distributions (Kalman filters only track one peak) and apply non-Guassian likelihoods (Kalman filters assume Gaussian noise, while you can weight particles in a particle filter using any kind of distribution).Particle filters do come at a cost of increased memory and processing usage. You need to propagate N particles at each epoch, each of which could have M dimensions of state (position, velocity, orientation, etc). So Kalman filters are likely preferred where memory and compute are at a premium.	skzv	5.144226	-1.7859997	comment	5.0	28.0	1615002688	11.015067

Chase is required by law to make the funds available after a couple days, just like all other banks. The OP's sister fell for a common scam that's been going on since forever, and Zelle warns you fairly explicitly to never send money to a stranger or else things like this could happen.Of course Chase isn't going to eat a $3,000 loss because a customer fell for a common scam and ignored Zelle's warnings and didn't even do a cursory look through the bank agreement which clearly explains how checks clear.The difference between the other services ""taking responsibility"" and ""not shaking down their customers"" and Chase Bank is that unlike a checking account, credit card transactions can be easily reversed. Once you send the money through"	LurkersWillLurk	5.163277	-1.8703972	comment	7.0	54.0	1602953845	-11.994584

I live in Europe - 95% of such attacks are prevented by something called Strong Customer Authentication, which anybody  serving or providing access to an account (cards including) must implement. Basically, that's 2FA implemented in myriad different ways. So, this Zelle thing wouldn't be possible at all: Zelle would have to ask for a SCA verification from the customer, just to connect/use his/her account in the first place. That would eliminate ground for such scamming messages ever appearing (if the customers knew and were accustomed to SCA).Though to be fair, scamming is still present here, typically involving calling older people and trying to persuade them to reveal bank access codes during a phone call.

36705255	I can never understand why some bloo	I can never understand why some bloom filter (or in this case IBLT) implementations insist on using multiple different independent hash functions.Just append a new salt to each input. For input ‘abc’ hashed say 8 times you simply construct abc-1, abc-2, abc-3, etc. up to abc-8 and hash each one and there you have 8 hash values that are no more prone to collisions than values produced by 8 independent hash functions.Concerned that abc-n might appear naturally in the input? Fine, append an odd string that’s unlikely to appear in the input if that really is your genuine concern. Or pass the salt in as a second parameter instead.And if your one hash function is so bad that abc-n is entangled with abc-n’, find a better hash function.I admit this is not my field so this may be a naive take.
