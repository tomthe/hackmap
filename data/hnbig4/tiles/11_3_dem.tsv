And as network users increased, reforming under a hub and spoke models to improve scale and capacity.And when a single IRC server went away after some time operating for its various reasons, the network kept going.Could the average IRC user start/host their own instance *and* link it to the larger network? No. But they didn't need to.	oogali	7.4979243	-4.3482995	comment	3.0	27.0	1665150714	9.393529

Sign in form uses various authentication methods but resource-wise, it will load user object and compare data at most. I decided to not use any captcha and let rate limiting do the heavy lifting if I get caught in some bot's eye. There really is no need for captcha because you can rate limit any page or form and once bot passes the threshold, nothing can happen since it is not a real user.

See the brief discussion of size limit on http://ircv3.net/specs/core/message-tags-3.2.htmlAdding tags forced them to increase message length because of how IRC messages are hilariously limited to 512 bytes in all directions. In the existing protocol you already have to guess how long your messages are allowed to be because the server tacks on a prefix to your message before relaying it, which can require it to truncate characters to fit the modified message into the length limit. Having some amount of tags tacked on as well would have made it impossible to guess how much room you had.Now if they had started with fixing the actual protocol they wouldn't have had to deal with that.

I would consider something to be a failure if it never took off the ground, instead we have a protocol that is over 30 years old being finally supplanted with newer technologies. There is no inherent reason why IRC failed, except that it was designed with the sensibilities of 1989 in mind, but the requirements of the modern day are not what they used to be. I enjoy the simplicity of IRC as much as the next guy, but when you have things such as a lack of chat history availability being something you have to work around, I understand why it has been supplanted by newer products, as has a vast majority of things from those days.	aquova	7.4864287	-4.344955	comment	3.0	11.0	1583703385	9.382712

It's easy to cook up your own protocol and have compatibility by being the only game in town but if you look at the bigger picture you have just created more fragmentation.

In practice, everything in a Matrix room is in a single thread. It definitely makes it hard to follow conversations that are long-lived or in busy rooms or both.Matrix is federated and Zulip isn't. You can run your own Matrix server and communicate with all the other Matrix servers that already exist.

You can run IRC on ancient gutless wonders, and it uses almost no resources.  Matrix, especially the flagship Element client, is a resource hog.  Start throwing rooms with thousands of users in, and it requires an awful lot of resources.Keep IRC IRC.	Syonyk	7.3921986	-4.2886367	comment	3.0	16.0	1621611970	9.92192

It is triggered most often for signup, but it can also appear for password reset, username lookup, sending mail, payments, login, and any other api routes which can be abused.That said, we can also understand the reaction. Back in 2014, there were no viable alternatives. Today, there is one alternative, and we started the transition to hCaptcha earlier this year, and will complete it in the coming weeks.For security reasons, we can't say too much, but some truly massive residential IP botnets have appeared in recent years and can make millions of attempts per day.

This work is on track to be completed in the next few weeks.

They weren't in a special IRC format, and you didn't open them with your IRC client. Hell, you couldn't open them with your IRC client. There's no reason you can't just ctrl-C a bunch of stuff out of a Slack chat and ctrl-V it into your text editor.

22814023	In my opinion and experience, ReCAPT	In my opinion and experience, ReCAPTCHA isn't really, really obnoxious most of the time. I suspect that most of the time it trips up bots who have no emotional experiences whatsoever. Most of my personal encounters with it involve solving no puzzles whatsoever. With that in mind, I expect humans and their completely real reactions might not be the default case. Of course, this is speculative, as I do not have any kind of special data on the subject.Thank you for sharing! Have you considered the possibility that presenting any message at all - especially one with a clear block time - is sending a very clear message to bot controllers? I'm sure you've considered this, and I am just failing to understand. Wouldn't that remove any real gains from being vague with tips & tricks?Wouldn't there a	Kalium	6.4265227	-4.6902294	comment	3.0	11.0	1586361181	5.6831183

After clicking all the right pictures of a bus, say, then I had to wait while they fade out and fade in new ones rather slowly.  There were about 5 rounds of selecting.  Then it would pick another noun and ask for that.  After a few nouns of a number of rounds each, it cycled back to the first noun.  A doubly-nested loop of time-delayed captchas!Thankfully it wasn't important.But it makes me appreciate how someone getting locked out of their own Gmail or Google Docs must feel.Needed to do your job today?

Happy to answer questions to the best of my ability :)As far as I'm aware, the focus of RIOT is to make embedded development as similar as possible to the way you'd write an application on Linux, including most of the relevant POSIX APIs. This is what, as far as I know, sets it apart from other systems such as Contiki or FreeRTOS, which have non-POSIX APIs for interaction with the OS.Someone on this thread asked why RIOT vs FreeRTOS is not something being compared. FreeRTOS doesn't really come with all the drivers, network stack etc that you need in order to write an embedded IoT application. That is not to say that it's not possible to do so, but it requires more work of picking the right drivers and libraries, whereas RIOT	x3ro	7.4793825	-4.2691545	comment	3.0	19.0	1548764698	9.966619

Once you start using noscript reCAPTCHA, you discover that your correct answers are accepted the first time every time.   The challenges have the same format; click the cars, click the traffic lights, etc.   There are two differences: the tiles don't fade in slowly, and the correct answers are always accepted.Presumably when google impl	darkpuma	6.42575	-4.6964	comment	3.0	12.0	1549219111	5.719421

Since trying it out for a while a few months ago, I have since abandoned it, however, because operating my own Synapse server was just too much work.Specific pain points were:- setting up SSL - getting Let’s Encrypt certs onto a server without a web server was a pain, and keeping them up to date was even worse. I would love to see ACMEv2 support integrated into Synapse for painless SSL setup.- TURN server - if you want to use voice chat, you need to set up a separate TURN server, which has its own set of challenges.

People have an innate narrative bias that constant hunts for horse races to spectate, and so you'll see a lot of ""Signal vs. Matrix"" arguments, but it's an artifact, not anything substantive."	tptacek	7.3629003	-4.268662	comment	3.0	13.0	1588887969	10.024948

Signal optimises for privacy at all costs and doesn't allow 3rd party clients or services.  See https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom for more.

But there is also kinda of a complementary aspect to that: in the past I had to write, for work, things like a non blocking POP3d for busy mail servers. The way the normal implementations worked was pretty terrible, so I developed a lot of appreciation for event-driven designs like the one in Redis, that tend to be very efficient. About IRC and the other text based protocols of the early days of Internet, I always thought that their inefficiency for certain tasks was never about the fact of being text-only, but because of the lack of prefixed length information. No prefixed length means two terrible things, an EOF signal of some kind but especially a way to quote such EOF in case it	antirez	7.4911885	-4.3467565	comment	3.0	13.0	1588954980	-6.334342

It supports Perfect Forward Secrecy (based on the Signal Protocol), arbitrary many devices and ""one verification for each individual"".Well, you might argue Matrix stores meta data server side (the ones chosen), while Signal at least doesn't have to.But do you really want to give up all that freedom trusting a single service provider in that really no data is kept?Maybe you can wait until Matrix allows you to avoid signing up on a server using P2P[0], then you have got it all, and don't have to commit to an alternative that has advantages, but also big draw backs.[0] https://news.ycomb"	kitkat_new	7.371614	-4.266965	comment	3.0	30.0	1631390807	9.990064
28496350	I love the idea behind Matrix and de	I love the idea behind Matrix and dearly want it to succeed, but unlike IRC and XMPP as well as (to a lesser extent) email and netnews, it has the inherent problem that it implements a genuinely difficult thing: a large partition-tolerant distributed database without a central authority and even a bit of mistrust between nodes. Now that I’ve put this in writing, I wonder if there were any attempts to do this at all before the current generation of systems. (IRC and netnews basically YOLO their consistency away because they can’t afford it, which was indeed correct when they were designed, but people did a lot of distributed systems work between then and now...) That implies that a Matrix server is necessarily somewhat heavy and rather difficult to implement.This makes me think that the fed	mananaysiempre	7.3632693	-4.271122	comment	3.0	13.0	1631396726	9.991029
28502361	Well, from my historical reading of 	Well, from my historical reading of it, initially, IRC was a federated network of servers that were essentially one network, the way email is one network: there was no shared administration or anything. Anyone could run a server and jump into the network. Due to abuse, servers began restricting who they peered with, and it fractured into multiple networks.So really, I suspect it was designed to be distributed and federated, and it just became what it is by accident.	jchw	7.4935875	-4.3441515	comment	3.0	12.0	1631462893	9.359698

IRCCloud may be (slightly) proprietary but at least it still only talks to IRC, and it's a good alternative to Slack&Friends (which are 100% proprietary) and webchat (which have the same issues as desktop clients and are generally atrociously ugly).Free IRCCloud accounts stay online 2 hours when shut off. I pay for mine, which stays online forever. It's a fairly similar experience to slack except I can still use the same open protocol as everyone else.Matrix is extremely promising but IMO not there yet.	scrollaway	7.5214653	-4.373212	comment	3.0	17.0	1470918936	9.39099

Break the barriers between apps, give the control back to the user to choose their client, if they want to encrypt, host themselves, tune the notifs, the fact it's open, built on the open ecosystem of Matrix and thus benefiting of all the integrations and bridges built for Matrix.... Sounds pretty revolutionary to me ;)Worth noting that only the name changed: the app and the team and the openness are still the same (modulo new features)!	amandine	7.3794794	-4.259055	comment	3.0	11.0	1474298095	10.008687

(I consider this a pretty big deal because silent message drops were a pretty regular issue for me in XMPP, and we all know about netsplits in IRC.  I've simply never had silent message loss in Matrix because the protocol is simply better.)	heavenlyhash	7.3534694	-4.305014	comment	3.0	16.0	1478372178	9.967789

Probably WhatsApp is your best choice.But if you actually need secure messaging, you should be using the safest secure messenger. Since we don't know who's reading these recommendations and what they're doing with them, we should employ the precautionary principle, and be clear with people that systems like Telegram, while probably fine for keeping messages out of the hands of jealous ex-partners, are simply not up to the task of protecting messages from serious, well-funded adversaries.	tptacek	7.228603	-4.7689233	comment	3.0	24.0	1478382008	-5.886479

You cannot subpoena a Tox network.Any messenger that requires and stores a phone number (read your real-world identity and physical location) is neither anonymous nor private.Also, a centralized messenger with a single server means that all traffic between all the users around the world goes through one data-center in one country that can do what? Observe the traffic and detect who is using this messenger, at least their IP address and country.Of course, for most users this doesn't change anything because they don't do anything illegal. But if they don't do anything illegal then they don't really need protection and can use VK or Telegram.	codedokode	7.2444134	-4.76268	comment	3.0	11.0	1539726921	-5.730786

From then on, it was widely seen as ""yet another thing of Facebook where they want all your data"" despite Whatsapp actually offering better encryption than Telegram.

I understand why it's not ideal, but there are tradeoffs in both directions.  It's unlikely that usernames are going to expose users more than they currently are if they're already using Signal.

I think that's not the case with Slack (?).

Many small startups and hobby sites don't have the resources to roll their own bot prevention/detection or subscribe to paid captcha solutions. Without recaptcha, these sites likely wouldn't exist or would be few and far between.> Your service could still be at risk, even with a CAPTCHA in place. Advances in computer imaging and the use of CAPTCHA farms means some bots will still be able to access your service.I don't think anyone will tell you that captchas are a 100% effective method at preventing automated/falsified actions. The main reason they are so widely used and generally the 'one stop shop' for bot prevention is that it increases the cost of attacking your service.

That's great, but that leaves you needing to trust a homeserver admin or host your own homeserver. Putting aside that there STILL isn't a finished homeserver implementation, you'll have to rely on a third party no matter what. Either it's hacker Joe (the admin of your homeserver), or the server hosting company that hosts your homeserver, or the DNS registrar who legally has to have your real identity...It may be theoretically possible to	twentydollars	7.3647118	-4.2670364	comment	3.0	20.0	1605378241	9.986193

Hell, it happens regularly on the second and especially the third try it will give you excruciatingly slowly crossfading images, and the last image routinely seems to need 2-4 clicks to finally make the object it wants you to identify go away.Hcaptcha (Cloudflare's alternative) is an absolutely breeze by comparison, and it even allows you to pre-generate a bunch of tokens via an extension (PrivacyPass)."	jorvi	6.4304056	-4.6914015	comment	3.0	10.0	1606479748	-7.7012486

Most rooms are not E2E, and have browsable history.Signal: Only E2E, with clients themselves storing the only copy of messages. You can only see messages that a device has received.Any app you did not write/review and compile requires trusting the author, so this is not a signal specific concern. A crypto app can always store and send keys to a server if it wanted.However, unlike WhatsApp, these apps are open source and can be reviewed and compiled if you so desire.	arghwhat	7.353615	-4.3028784	comment	3.0	10.0	1610300221	-5.7128816

This is only misleading to the non-tech users who don't get how the whole thing works. That's why Telegram's claim of security is total garbage because while their client is ""open source"", the backend is that has all the messages is not. Something they don't clearly state on their website.So the Telegram's admins can read all the messages in plain text on the backend.

The last straw was failing the CAPTCHA at Bill.com where I failed the CAPTCHA and was using a VPN and got my account banned and couldn't get paid for a contract.

I then get to communicate with all those contacts in one place (I'm on Android so iMessage not a problem).I signed up the moment it came out and they had some teething reliability problems for a while, but it's been great for months now. Element is a much better web client than any of the others and it's nice to not have to worry about which computer or platform I'm on when I want to write a message.	rkangel	7.3654613	-4.39555	comment	3.0	19.0	1677767301	-5.7579527

Before the website or the discord, it was just a bunch of people following each other on Twitter and a few disparate talks. Starting from there and asking new joiners to set up a new platform adds prohibitive friction.

This is true of every internet service, and is how the internet works. Tools to solve this (e.g. Tor, VPNs) are well known and established solutions if you need to hide your IP from websites and services you use.Common alternatives to XMPP that people may recommend include Signal and Matrix, but both certainly see your IP address just as easily.XMPP uses passwords for authentication, rather than phone numbers. Since the server needs to use the password to verify you are you, there should be no surprise that it is sent to the server when you	MattJ100	7.3403964	-4.3656487	comment	3.0	26.0	1636017883	-12.516671

It's true that Synapse can use a lot of RAM.- The biggest cause of this is due to spikes in RAM during state resolution (the merge resolution algorithm used to converge your server's view of a room with the other servers in a room), which Python doesn't always recover nicely.  We fixed the main cause of this in Synapse 1.26, which was released on Wednesday: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622 is interesting reading on the details.- Another cause is that by default we cache a lot of data in RAM in order to avoid hammering the DB.  Currently you have to manually tune the size of that cache, which should be done automatically - we're hoping to get to this shortly.- The other main cause is that the resource 	Arathorn	7.383259	-4.273818	comment	3.0	10.0	1612090277	9.980892

If you choose to share your location publicly on Telegram, you’ll appear in a list for users who are physically close to you.As always, it feels like this ""discovery"", at least for the headline (which, let's be honest, it's what most people read anyway) is based on glancing over the fact that this feature is opt-in, and that 99,999% of Telegram users do not use it. There's nothing in the headline indicating whether this is a critical data leak or simply expected behavior.Sure, it definitely falls under unexpected usage of the data, but at the end of the day, the data was shared willfully through user action."	hnarn	7.2157965	-4.77531	comment	3.0	14.0	1612551225	-5.874296

If you input a line which is more than 510 characters after being prefixed with the channel name, server name, and other metadata, it may be truncated for some clients. If you're on a network which includes multiple servers, some clients may actually see your message truncated in different locations, based on how long their local server's name is.* No standard text encoding. Some clients assume ISO8859-1, some assume UTF-8, and some will mix and match (ew).* No way to determine when certain commands have succeeded.

Once I get people to use Telegram and describe how it's different and better than WhatsApp (except default E2E), they realize that it is indeed nicer, and want to reduce using WhatsApp.Wire is fine (not as good as or fast as Telegram), but the company seems to be focused on paying customers to increase revenues. So free customers hardly get any support or responses from support (the auto-replies from Wire support state this priority). I like that Wire is by default E2E and syncs conversations across devices and platforms!I've been waiting to recommend Signal to others for at least three or four years now.

How is a federated protocol supposed to work like that?I think XMPP just failed to cater to any audience.  The Googles and Facebooks could roll their own and for everyone else it was too cumbersome.

Discord Inc. runs the servers, and you use whatever software they approve to connect.  Using unapproved software could result in a ban from the service.IRC is a set of protocols to enable a federated service.  You choose which server implementation you want to host, and your users choose from dozens of available clients, which all work together because of the relevant standards, to which everyone has access.The rest of your comment seems to be a comparison of Matrix, which is not IRC, and Discord.  It's great that you've found a product you like, which suits your needs.  Don't make the mistake of thinking IRC is competing with it, though.

It was previously run by a company who kept trying to monetize the IP, then it was run by a few people who split off that company (and still kept trying to figure out how to monetize it and pay themselves a wage with it). I'm not against the devs being able to pay themselves, that's great, but the specs themselves shouldn't be run that way. Existing standards bodies have more experience, more legal protections for the users, and are just generally better at developing standards.

This works great for desktop computers, but as you add more devices with more intermittent connectivity, it breaks down quickly as you need to resort to hacks like sending deltas to other devices as carbon copies, which may or may not be delivered or interpreted correctly by clients.

There is no group end-to-end encryption; rather, Telegram claims that TLS hop-by-hop encryption --- in which Telegram's own servers get to see message plaintext --- is sufficient.Signal provides true end-to-end encryption, for groups, by default, always-on, in a privacy-preserving design that ensures that Signal's servers don't have to collect a log of who's talking to who. Signal won the Levchin Prize at Real World Crypto --- in fact, they won the first Levchin prize ever awarded, meaning that when Dan Boneh and Tom Ristenpart and Kenny Paterson and the other referees sat down to figure out	tptacek	7.2221603	-4.771561	comment	4.0	14.0	1582043792	-5.9227805

Even things like account creation and payments are exposed.The protocol is very esoteric and hard to understand, though. It wouldn't necessarily have to be that way, it just feels like their documentation is aimed at mathematicians, not developers, especially the parts concerning binary serialization. They definitely suffer from a ""reinvent the wheel"" syndrome, they have a proprietary client-server encryption layer where plain old HTTPS would do, same for data serialization.

The protocols involved are called Olm and Megolm.Olm is used for establishing 1-on-1 sessions between pairs of users (or rather, their devices). This is then used as a secure channel to share Megolm keys. A Megolm key is ratcheted with each room message sent and is used to derive a symmetric AES key with which the message is actually encrypted. Periodically (every N messages) a new Megolm key is created and re-shared with room participants.So the end result is that it has roughly the same security as Signal, except that a single compromised Megolm key will reveal N messages to the attacker instead of just a single message.

They are effectively sent from the sending device to the receiving device. This means that your messages reside on your device. When you use the desktop or web client, it's basically remote operating your phone.This famously allowed Whatsapp to achieve massive scale with relatively few resources.

This allows for features such as those discussed above - multiple synchronized clients etc. The downside (aside from potential privacy concerns) is that it requires much larger amount of infrastructure, which presumably is one of the reasons they need $700 million.[1] http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/3	ddeck	7.2432957	-4.7647624	comment	4.0	13.0	1615828175	-5.8989925

Having used many chat platforms that have been shut down/acquired/etc in the past, that’s not a bet I’m willing to take.I’d also contest the idea that Matrix can never have a client as usable as Signal, but I’ll agree that there isn’t one yet.	ryukafalz	7.37386	-4.2689433	comment	4.0	36.0	1603144794	10.070016

End-to-end encryption being device-specific. Example: if you start a secret chat from your phone, you can't view it on your other devices. Other end-to-end encrypted solutions don't have this drawback.2. End-to-end encryption being available only in one-to-one communications. Take this with a grain of salt, but I don't think it's available at all in group chats and channels.	input_sh	7.235996	-4.762133	comment	4.0	15.0	1603460025	-5.8557615

There are even CAPTCHA solving companies that offer thousands of solves for $1.This is probably a bad argument when your proof of work captcha can be solved for much cheaper. Your site says ""Solving it will take a few seconds on a desktop computer"", which I'll interpret as 5 seconds. The spot price for a c5a.2xlarge instance (8 thread zen2 CPU) is 21.6 cents/hr. That works out to 0.03 cents per solve, an order of magnitude less than the 0.1 cents per solve for commercial recaptcha solving services.

Mirc was the jam.I'm working on a new open chat site, https://sqwok.im, and hoping to recapture some of that essence. Particularly the simplicity, and lack of overly strict moderation like you describe. Irc never hit mainstream because the majority of users would never download and install a client, but it's neat that with modern web technology we can finally build these experiences in a way that general users can enjoy.	holler	7.502076	-4.3252797	comment	4.0	19.0	1605465455	9.378376

To aid with this when setting the difficulty for your website it shows you an estimate for various device types. This is indeed a downside of PoW approaches.There is one factor that helps: you can start solving as soon as the form loads, so as the user enters their details/comment it can start solving - I have a hunch that people on mobile devices are inherently slower at entering their data which should help a bit..Anyway - if you set the difficulty quite high and the solving takes 30 seconds, it takes 	protoduction	6.4416275	-4.6845694	comment	4.0	14.0	1606340313	-7.680448

There were some changes planned but apparently the whole thing would be better off rewritten in a new form, and the effort never really kicked off, much like the protocol itself faded from use as we moved towards more and more hybrid networks and uses.It's a sad realization, I always thought XMPP would save the day some day, but apparently there's a lot of work between now and there. And it might just as well be called something else. I think the latest move towards HTTP/3 enforcing SSL1.3 is one way to envision a fully secured web, 10 years from now.

Yet we do not see such actions taken against companies that produce collectibles.This is probably because when adding the second, you see there is a major theme of profit redistribution. In all of those cases profit is collected centrally and then redistributed.

Many channels publish chat logs publicly, which can be downloaded and searched using grep or your tool of choice. And there are web clients that can do this.> Also, because there are so many IRC clients, and so many servers out there, one person's IRC experience can vastly differ from another's.That’s rather the point of a protocol, no? IRC isn’t a platform, it’s a standardized way in which various clients and servers can communicate. Much like email, different clients support features useful for different users.> IRC also doesn't have any of the modern amenities like emoji reactions or reaction gifs, comme	charlesdaniels	7.4966717	-4.3446684	comment	4.0	18.0	1572583610	9.347116
21563294	In the last year I had to re-impleme	In the last year I had to re-implement one of the libraries for working with XMPP on another platform. It's horrible and not pleasant to work with at all.I guess most of the developers that worked with it had a bad time. That would be my bet why it hasn't taken of.IMO we need something simpler, websocket and JSON based. Less standards, less use-cases - for example I don't think xmpp should take care of vcards, nickname and tons of other things I forgot about. Programmer should be able to grok it realtively quickly and then specifics of your application should take longer to understand instead of having to spend ages on XMPP first and then ages on your specific hacks around it.	ponyous	7.3389254	-4.369472	comment	4.0	23.0	1574074139	-12.51559

Even though Signal is private and open source, they are hostile towards people running their own Signal builds on company servers, and unwilling to federate with other servers.Essentially, you run the official Signal app on the official Signal servers, or GTFO.	pepijndevos	7.3674846	-4.2878437	comment	4.0	20.0	1575916909	10.008872

Even if an event doesn’t seem likely, I can still prepare. For example, if I see kids playing basketball in a driveway, I’m going to slow down, incase the ball bounces into the street and a kid takes off after it without looking.

But for bots, it dramatically limits how many submissions each botnet host can make to random websites.	timmaxw	6.485211	-4.6643744	comment	4.0	34.0	1659595327	-7.546328

Client and server developers were always disjointed, working separately from each other. This lead to great inconsistencies in implementations of even such basic functions like adding a contact. Also, it often happens that when a client developers need some feature that honestly should be done by a server, a developer still does this on a client, because it's all he has, with subpar results.Absent leadership from XSF also plays a role.

If you can set up a server application it's not hard but it's not exactly easy to get started, or get people on it without handholding (from my own experience).	tetraca	7.349603	-4.366236	comment	4.0	20.0	1653584352	-12.508619

When Discord rolls out a new feature, you can trust it to work for everyone on day one. There is no querying available features for the other side, it just works. And you know it shows up how you imagine on the other side every time.IRC spent most of the last decade rolling out the V3 spec which came with hard hitting features like logging in to accounts (SASL), away notifications, showing the time a message was sent rather than the time it was received by your client.Still working on signing up for a new account on the todo list.The glacial pace of open standards like IRC is the reason proprietary tools which can just get things done took over.

We might be ""afk"" for a bit, but generally would be back soon. If you saw someone's nick on irc, it was very likely that they were online and active. Even with ICQ and AOL, it was pretty apparent if people were online or not. If they weren't online, or you didn't need a quick response you sent them an email.As DSL and broadband became more popular, chat moved to being more asynchronous. Chat clients started synchronizing message history with the server to make it avaialble on all your devices. It was easier to leave your presence online, even when you were unreachable.IRC itself still retains a lot of that realtime chat, mainly because of its transient nature.

MTProtov1 criticisms aside, the E2EE system Telegram uses is perfectly safe.It's just disabled by default, unavailable in group chats or channels, and enabling it reduces usability (i.e. you can't use multiple devices to chat if you enable E2EE).Telegram as a chat app has the best UX of any chat app out there in my opinion, so the lack of proper E2EE is simply disappointing. I don't really trust either, but I consider WhatsApp more secure than Telegram, despite Meta mining my metadata.	jeroenhd	7.2303653	-4.7672577	comment	4.0	26.0	1654350020	-5.8511767

""Presence"" is the feature that shows a little indicator next to each one of your contacts indicating whether they're online or away.The problem with presence is that it generates a LOT of traffic.  It's N^2 with the average number of contacts each user has - every time a user changes presence, you have to send a message to every one of their contacts to update them about the presence.  This happens whether they're paying attention to your client or not.  So on a large system, the big majority of the traffic is just presence messages flying back and forth saying who is at their keyboard and who isn't.  This is really wasteful in general.

Telegram messenger was banned here but it still works. I guess that they frequently change IP addresses and use multiple cloud providers.
When Roscomnadzor tried to ban the messenger, they added significant number of IP subnetworks (I think that the largest blocked subnet was 52.192.0.0/11 used by AWS).

Like with DoH, what makes Matrix most attractive is the ability to implement solutions using pre-existing web application stacks, like Node.js. It's a sort of path dependency where the easiest way to implement a simple solution starts with a very complex, mostly superfluous foundation.The fact that port 80 and 443 are less likely to be blocked is a distant, secondary factor. Frankly, I've never been on a network that blocked other outbound ports. And I've definitely never seen a network where hosted services could only ever receive traffic on port 80 or 443. Rather, I think it's more (if not entirely) a matter of people justifying the use of web stacks to implement services which cry out for simpler solutions.	wahern	7.366805	-4.264034	comment	5.0	16.0	1556338796	9.9938135

Simply saying, if you have anti-goverment channels/chats/friends in you Telegram, before walk outside, you remove/hide them   in order no to have issues if police officer stop you and ask to unlock your phone (rarely, but happens). Same for Belarus.Many reasons why Telegram is (most probably) safe. There are a lot of black/gray area stuff here like drugs etc. That people (i don't support them) trust Telegram showing us it's secure.And the Telegram's owner (Pavel Durov) relocated from Russia for ever due to issues with his previous project (VK) when goverment asked to show private/personal data.	souvlakee	7.202617	-4.7859473	comment	5.0	21.0	1670416171	-5.957711

Matrix should enable a place to keep your message archive independent of the bounce server, and allow gatewaying a non-public storage service via the lightweight bounce service.But Element.io's business model is tied to heavy-weight bounce service.	ncmncm	7.3532524	-4.281058	comment	5.0	21.0	1617732537	10.013946

At that point in time, this was not so trivial, as the GTK support for native MacOSX was experimental (http://www.gtk-osx.org/). You could simply use the X11 GTK version but I rather wanted to have a native version. I have no idea what the current state is with GTK on MacOSX. This Pidgin build is obviously very outdated now (from 2009), and probably does not run on recent MacOSX versions (they are frequently breaking backward compatibility...).	albertzeyer	7.412334	-4.313438	comment	5.0	20.0	1611331379	-6.026086

24067791	A little over a decade ago now, back	A little over a decade ago now, back when the Sony PSP was current, there was a neat little homebrew IM client called AFKIM. It used bitlbee to connect to various IM services (AIM, GTalk, MSN, etc.) and worked pretty well for something running on a PSP.The keyboard, though, was great:http://localhost.geek.nz/afkim/docs/usingafkim.htmlIt's a 3x3 matrix. You use the analog stick to pick a square, then hit one of the face buttons to enter a character. Left and right shoulder buttons shifted the keyboard to uppercase, numbers, specials, etc.IIRC it was a Lua module that any PSP homebrewer could drop into their application for a pretty decent OSK.	nyx_	7.5312266	-4.2722206	comment	5.0	15.0	1596683302	5.057459

If XMPP is so extensible, why haven’t those extensions quickly brought it up to speed with the modern world?Like any federated protocol, extensions don’t mean much unless everyone applies them, and that’s an almost impossible task in a truly federated landscape.

If they had enabled federation it would have solved the Slack problem to a certain degree.Matrix could have done the same thing, but they chose to waste time and money reinventing the wheel (and doing a bad job of it) instea	SamWhited	7.3608675	-4.2867527	comment	5.0	30.0	1545324603	9.998946

The reason is that it's easier for project maintainers to create new Discord servers + channels.  E.g. :  https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-...Put a different way...

I am in the #clojure room semi-often (asking silly questions), and occasionally the Haskell room if I'm up for learning a bit more about theory.I like how simple IRC is, but I get why so many people have an aversion towards it.  In the age of Slack, telling people to install Weechat and connect to a server manually is kind of scary.  I largely embrace the transition to something new, but I do have an issue with the open-source world moving to a proprietary platform.I wish XMPP were more popular, since I think a federated chat system with an open protocol is pretty neat, but sadly I fear that the Slack hype-train might be a bit too far-go	tombert	7.4387884	-4.3516474	comment	6.0	48.0	1559862116	9.459867

And of the channels that do have real people, those people often seem to be there for no reason other than to tell people to RTFM, play topic nazi to such an extreme level that apparently nothing is actually on topic, or just generally berate people for having the gall to say something in the channel.

Do you consider that a CAPTCHA? Or is it something else?
Now that's one system that I would like to see beaten.
From the article:    Yep, it generates 4-letter CAPTCHAs using a random mix of four different fonts.
    And we can see that it never uses “O” or “I” in the codes
    to avoid user confusion.

IRC has been around for a very long time.  As such, the earlier versions of the servers and daemons could not accept tens of thousands of client connections ePoll vs Select.  The connections between servers are multiplexed and not directly related to the number of people connected to the server.  There was also a matter of latency.

To take track of the time she wears it was a pita, so I wrote another bot (not released so far) and put it in our family channel.Then... I needed another bot.

A feature like that worked just fine because the color codes were mostly invisible to those who weren't using a client that supported them. In this way, mIRC and other clients could move the protocol forward via graceful degradation without having to wait for a new IRC specification update.I can imagine the same thing being done to email, where modern features could be built on top of email, which just gracefully degrade if those features aren't available in the client (e.g. something similar to inline source maps, which can decorate pa	jameslk	7.4820065	-4.360771	comment	6.0	25.0	1503960233	9.354491

So while Matrix could potentially (or already does) link up with Signal, this app doesn't seem like it could get traction/expand because of the dubious base that it stands on.	nexthash	7.374742	-4.287591	comment	6.0	26.0	1613005623	9.98225

WA either has them unencrypted or can see my phone’s secret key in transit. Isn’t the whole point of END to END messaging being undecipherable on devices other than these two?Or how does that work? Is my browser establishing e2e to my phone and downloading all chats? This seems unlikely. Does it synchronize the secret key? Then I see it as a security hole — I don’t want my secret chats to leak to other devices that may be not as protected as a phone.	wruza	7.251153	-4.7566085	comment	7.0	32.0	1565488499	-5.79208

Don’t require captchas for logins unless a reasonable limit of attempts has been exceeded (5 wrong passwords within 24h by the same ip for example).If your site is small, a captcha is often overkill.

The client API is not easy to use, as crypto and similar features are involved, but C libraries exist. On the other hand, the bot API is one of the most pleasant APIs I've ever seen. It just works, can be tested in the browser, there's no oAuth crap one needs to set up. It's beautifully simple.

I don't think it actually breaks things the way this article describes, it seems like a gentler behavior, but it's annoying.A few months ago I got on Akamai's naughty list (with my other ISP) for some very light automated website downloading. That was a straight block with HTTP errors and I had to use a proxy to access the Web. It cleared up after a few days.The lack of any user feedback or support for this situation is really annoying. Reminds you how much power the CDNs have. It'd be really bad if loading websites got as difficult as sending email through all the layers of spam filtering.

If I made a mistake or was insufficiently human for it, I got a new challenge and tried again. There are apocryphal stories of Google tar-pitting users with it, but I have never seen it in action.If this judges the browser more than the user, what do I do when the browser fails?

It connects to a network like a normal client and instead of connecting directly to an irc network you connect to it. Usually you would set it up to log for you and show you some or all of the messages it received while you were disconnected. In this way your nick is always present in your channels and you can see what was talked about while you were away.source: https://www.reddit.com/r/irc/comments/35vcth/comment/cr86hcs...	eterps	7.4875393	-4.3467255	comment	7.0	61.0	1657113052	9.381196

Does federating with the greater Matrix ecosystem cost that much extra processing power, that one user's chats are taking multiple gigs of RAM and gigabytes of space?

Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you're trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down.

I'm currently able to send and receive messages from Hangouts, iMessage, SMS, and Slack all from within Matrix. If I'm working on my laptop I can put my phone in my bag and not even touch it for 8 hours, because there's no need. I have Riot running on my laptop with a full keyboard and access to all my communication platforms.It's not exactly easy to do (iMessage requires a dedicated Mac, for example), but it's possible. And it works pretty well. Pulling out my phone to tap out an SMS when I have a full keyboard in front of me seems silly at this point.

Unfortunately, the data doesn't seem to differentiate between the people who use IRC regularly and those who don't for the question of whether they like IRC.  The question I'm wondering; is it the people who use Matrix who dislike IRC or is it evenly split between those who use IRC or Matrix?  (I have a suspicion, but that would be speculating without evidence.)Reasonable people will disagree, but I think IRC's lack of features is actually an advantage and not a disadvantage.  My opinion is that the Matrix protocol is too powerful.  That being said, for a project like GNOME, it's extremely important that one maintains a form of communication that those engaged are willing to use.I realise I	Svip	7.4088035	-4.2992806	comment	10.0	63.0	1651405109	9.784767

Sure, projects shouldn't be using Discord for everything, there should be documentation and stuff available online, but for fluid discussion and getting help from others users, I don't see any decent alternatives.	ejj28	7.4119434	-4.280032	comment	10.0	43.0	1709357968	9.704647

I understand XMPP with its extensions and use of XML fragments might be complex, but it sounds like matrix or another new protocol isn't easier. In a way, those willing to invest time into F/OSS chat apps have done the best they could with XMPP, and  creating a new community around a protocol for no good reasons seems like a wasteful thing to do.

That said, I can see it slowly turning into a walled garden. For example, in public channels (distinct from groups, they're broadcast only) it should be possible to link to their content from the outside. Instead if you try that they force you to download the app to see the content. EDIT2: As someone noted you can link each individual post on a channel, but you can't see and scroll through a list of posts as you can from inside the app.I wish we had a messaging app with a market as large as WhatsApp's, UX as good as Telegram, security as good as Signal, run by an organization li	fwdpropaganda	7.2330513	-4.7598825	comment	11.0	52.0	1518020909	-5.9374843

With Telegram you cannot even do a phone number enumeration attack (this can be changed in settings) by adding phone numbers to your contacts list to find out who's using it.And nope, Signal doesn't make the cut for the above reasons because it exposes your phone number to everyone else. WhatsApp is the same in this respect. Neither of them prevent enumeration attacks (they may slow that down a bit, but not sufficient enough to protect against state actors).	newscracker	7.234687	-4.7638893	comment	12.0	72.0	1598038604	-5.837606

But they demanded to immediately remove any information that discloses someone's data on the Internet without the consent of these persons, as well as content aimed at specific people in accordance with the rules of the App Store.This refers to the efforts of the Belorussian opposition to 'unmask' members of the riot police by posting their personal details online.

While others like Whatsapp bother with e2ee and resulting device sync problems and inability to do server-side search, Telegram just stores everything on a server without (meaningful) encryption and boldly claims that 'it is the most secure messenger'. And, imagine that, users just believe that it is the most secure! (I did talk to MANY people who repeated this word for word, 'Telegram is the most secure and encrypted messenger app!', and yes, nobody of them used Secret chats, - it doesn't nicely sync, and nobody needs disappearing messages anyway.

 - Gitter, now owned by GitLab;

So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That's not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all.

We normally get less than 1.I was keeping an eye on it, because we are hard-capped at 100 QPS to our provider, beyond that and they start dropping our traffic (and it is an outside provider, bundling domain registries like verisign and stuff), which makes regular users break if their traffic gets unlucky.Anyway, after a week of 40qps, they start spiking to 200+, and we pull the plug on the whole thing: now each request to our endpoint	pfooti	6.4322944	-4.693472	comment	14.0	133.0	1685334982	5.697021

Everyone did since they launched a new app and made everyone switch to that and re-login.Some of the solutions are clearly just wrong. I have a PhD in Computer Science and if I am failing multiple basic addition problems, I assure you that it isn't me, the answers are wrong.I had to do the same audio puzzles and got the first audio puzzle wrong too, and I even had my partner helping me. It is clearly just a bad test bank. Which begs the question, if the answers are wrong and there are only 3 choices, then what's the point? Regardless of whether you are human or not you are going to guess it eventually in about 5 tries, which is what it gives you before locking you out.	jacurtis	6.4341607	-4.6859646	comment	16.0	118.0	1685401704	5.8739333

Before you use a CAPTCHA of any kind, consider very carefully if you really need one.I've seen this a number of times in design meetings: someone will say ""oh, an account registration form, we will of course need a CAPTCHA there"", everyone will nod their heads and move on. In reality, in most of those cases, no one will ever conceivably even try to automate/script the thing being designed."	jwr	6.4323792	-4.6854353	comment	16.0	86.0	1687435950	-7.7151856

The exact details will vary based on the type of service, of course.One particularly egregious misuse of captcha in a service I use presents one after I enter a correct username and password. An incorrect login says so without presenting a captcha. The potential reward for an attacker who successfully gains access to an account is high, so it seems almost certain anyone running a targeted attack would defeat this by handing it off to a hum	Zak	6.4336886	-4.6864524	comment	16.0	157.0	1606334120	-7.626115

16117487	Here's how WhatsApp group messaging 	Here's how WhatsApp group messaging works: membership is maintained by the server. Clients of a group retrieve membership from the server, and clients encrypt all messages they send e2e to all group members.If someone hacks the WhatsApp server, they can obviously alter the group membership. If they add themselves to the group:1. The attacker will not see any past messages to the group; those were e2e encrypted with keys the attacker doesn't have.2. All group members will see that the attacker has joined. There is no way to suppress this message.Given the alternatives, I think that's a pretty reasonable design decision, and I think this headline pretty substantially mischaracterizes the situation.

Also, updates frequently force a logout and the password reset procedure is quite clunky.I finally realized that the web version works pretty well so now I just use that when I need to use Slack.I know this makes me sound old, but I really wish popular open source projects would just stick to IRC as it just works and doesn't require any proprietary client (and isn't trying to turn into video chat, screen sharing, etc.) Or I suppose I wish S	grandalf	7.5387425	-4.3927603	comment	20.0	114.0	1501131077	9.312437

When jQuery was hip, the js community celebrated ""Graceful degradation"". I frequently have the feeling this attitude is lost. That's super sad because it also excludes all the handycapped people.Does even anybody remember the good old HTTP basic acess authentification? This is one of the most accessible ways of protecting ressources, it can be consumed by any HTTP client (!), and it is just reduced to the basic.One of the worst things are these terrible captchas everywhere.

36919069	> The reliability and lack of bloat 	"> The reliability and lack of bloat that are inherent to IRC ultimately also means that there are a number of fancy modern features that Discord has that IRC lacks, a big one being the inability to view backlogs of conversations that transpired while one was not connected to an IRC server. Although IRC does not itself provide this functionality, the extremely simple nature of IRC allows for a couple of lightweight options for reliably remaining on IRC around the clock and not missing out on a word that anyone says.The article brushes over this, but IMO the lack of built-in backlog support is the main reason why IRC is essentially doomed. Logging isn't a ""fancy"" feature and telling people to just run an always-on logging service on top doesn't cut it.Especially when there are open, federate"	ginko	7.51975	-4.3181677	comment	24.0	260.0	1690629287	9.346226
