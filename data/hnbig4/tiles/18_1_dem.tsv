I've avoided it since it seems every year the language or the API changes... has it now settled?  I really didn't want to go back rewriting code every year.		mozumder

You don't spend years developing a language (Swift) as culmination of previous work (LLVM) and then abandon it for a job in a relatively new and different discipline. It doesn't make much sense to me.		gtrubetskoy
