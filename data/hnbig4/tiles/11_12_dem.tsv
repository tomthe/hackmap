There you tend to meet a lot of people who have tried to find help for their health issues and try yoga as a last resort. Unfortunately yoga isn't a cure for lots of people either.But just listen to their stories. If you have something like autoimmune disease, chronic fatigue, undiagnosed Lyme's disease or other stuff a lot of people including medical professionals will accuse you of lying and pretending. This goes on while it's very clear that people are suffering. Some people are lucky that eventually they get diagnosed with something that's in the textbooks like Lyme's but a lot of them don't and their life is miserable. It's miserable because of suffering but also because they get treated like pretenders.	maxxxxx	6.988877	6.3051167	comment	3.0	15.0	1500304824	-13.718361

Know where they hang out and try not to go into deep grass. After a hike, shed all your clothes and shoes carefully and wash it all. Take a shower and either have someone check you out or do a self inspection.Some places, like desert climates, I have never seen any. One of the worst hikes I’ve encountered I was in Idaho by a river and must have seen 100. I literally turned around and stopped the hike. I usually start by looking at the tips of grass blades hanging over the trail. As you walk 	r0m4n0	7.030189	6.2947555	comment	3.0	12.0	1624337993	11.949543

The problem with Lyme disease is that it's symptoms are very wide and generic, and the commonly used tests are not very reliable. This means that many people live with the disease not aware of it, while others self-diagnose Lyme disease and cure it even if they didn't have it (because they had symptoms like longterm brain fog).	skocznymroczny	6.9919353	6.3301706	comment	3.0	12.0	1629195602	-13.718575

A round of antibiotics seems to have killed it, though I am still noticeably more tired than before the infection (anacdata, could just be because I'm getting older and under a lot of stress).I reported where and when the infection took place on a local website which tracks these things. I informed the city council (considering this happened in a very busy public park) and I was pretty much told that nothing would be done. More green spaces would help. Keeping certain animals (like chickens) might also help. Killing the fuckers outright is another possibility, but I have to admit to being relucant about spraying toxic crap in public parks.

If you wait until you feel sick a few weeks later, you've waited too long.

15686985	"The documentary ""Under our Skin"" det"	"The documentary ""Under our Skin"" details Alan MacDonald's breakthrough research on how Lyme disease causes Alzheimers. The 4 minute trailer is worth a watch[1], but basically Lyme disease is found in 7 or 10 brains of Alzheimers patients (small sample set). The Lyme disease spirochete literally drills countless pathways in the brain and that causes slow dementia. That spirochete also creates a biofilm which makes it challenging to detect in a living patient. His research is from a decade or two ago.Also I wonder how a citizen scientist like Gates does a deep dive on this topic a like this.  There are 10's of thousands of research papers on the subject[1] and countless books.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCLwauRh2gQ

22765603	Lyme disease talk just makes me thin	Lyme disease talk just makes me think of Nicholas Zakas and then I get bummed out.I know there's a guy, or maybe he represents a group of researchers, who thinks that Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is caused by inflammation in the brain, either due to some undetectable infection, or just a misfiring that is a lingering effect of some other insult (sounds to me like a histamine response aka allergy).If your body thought you had the flu but you didn't, you'd be knocked on your ass not unlike many people with CFS or Lyme. And if it never stopped you'd be in pretty bad shape a year in.So. Are we treating microbes that don't culture in a petri dish, or are we solving an autoimmune response gone whacky? You could really ask the same question about Crohn's or IBS.I recall years ago reading a long story	hinkley	7.013138	6.2911806	comment	8.0	40.0	1585877456	-13.693813

The antibiotics regime was easily one of the lowest points in my life - just felt terrible for weeks.The thing I was taught by this experience, is to never, ever screw around with it.  In my case I was attacked by a swarm of ticks during a hot period (Vienna, Austria) and I kind of ignored the bites .. thought nothing of them after discovering the ticks (2) and removing them .. but after 2 days, I had 4 red splotches over my body, and it was clear that I had the characteristic 'bullseye' symptoms.Thought ""okay, I can live through this"" and didn't do anything about it for about 5 - 6 weeks; splotches went away, and I thought I was fine.  No.  Just, no.  I was not fine.Aches and pains like none I've experienced before (be"	mmjaa	6.9924583	6.321253	comment	9.0	70.0	1517408075	11.961677

That's what killed Lymerix, and why we don't have Lyme disease vaccine anymore. If the government does not back it up, the manufacturer won't stand a chance.Even if the vaccine has a good safety profile, a 0.1% rate of side effects applied to millions is still a lot of lawsuits.	sonicggg	6.9931164	6.3321466	comment	9.0	80.0	1639723885	-13.717922

An unpredictable touch confuses it, sending it into a mini frenzy. Self-touch is always predictable … so, no frenzy.But Brecht thinks it’s not really about prediction. Instead, he suggests that as a person touches themselves, the brain sends out a body-wide message that inhibits touch sensitivity. “We think what is happening is the brain has a trick to know: As soon as you touch yourself, don’t listen,” he says. If it didn’t, he argues, we’d all be constantly tickling ourselves every time we scratched an armpit or touched our toes.""--The question was mildly interesting but I'm pretty grumpy about reading long, long, loooong articles that are supposed to answer N questions, where the "	emmanueloga_	7.0528293	6.2435417	comment	10.0	59.0	1665366169	11.911242

The pop-culture version of Lyme disease discussed on the Internet has almost no resemblance to the actual medical science. There are a lot of people genuinely suffering unexplained symptoms, real pain, who are drawn into the seductive explanations of the “chronic Lyme” communities online.Quackery like this is commonplace. Usually there’s a thread of potential science buried somewhere in the treatments, like the idea of bee stings triggering a beneficial immune response. However, the common theme is always a complete lack of actual research and total hit or miss response rate among people who try these experiments on themselves.One common theme in the chronic 	PragmaticPulp	6.9909544	6.32009	comment	12.0	56.0	1575495296	-13.6884165

The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it's way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough.	spicybright	7.019108	6.300506	comment	14.0	90.0	1629196040	11.958368
