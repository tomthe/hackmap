Yet, scientists are doing this and there are genetic and neurotransmitter markers which are abnormal in people classified with ADHD.

In X number of decades, there's a very good chance we will all look back and realize how dead wrong we were about ADHD, attention, and our extremely crude methods of ""curing"" it.It blows my mind that especially in American society we are so accepting of putting millions of people on amphetamines to solve attention disorders. Anyone who has gone through higher-ed in the past 10 years knows a huge number of students are on these meds, and even if they suffer some of attention disorder, they are likely at a large advantage after adding the drugs. I'd love to see the percentage of med school students on these drugs."	mattwest	14.137681	4.1329627	comment	3.0	18.0	1664898135	-12.5604315

33180695	> Surprisingly, data show that sugar	> Surprisingly, data show that sugar consumption does not worsen symptoms of ADHD.Surprisingly? Sugar consumption is known to help with symptoms of ADHD, as do other dopamine-inducing activities, which makes perfect sense to me. The problem with sugar is that it has a pretty high cost due to all its other effects on the body, that its dopamine hit wears off pretty fast and you quickly build up a tolerance, which is why it's good to look for other stimulants than sugar.	seba_dos1	14.144739	4.147362	comment	3.0	14.0	1665597992	-12.556874

If yes, then whether they have apparent Disorder X (a figment of imagination) versus actual Disorder X (which is itself also a figment of our collective imagination) isn’t super relevant. Obviously in the case of ADHD the prescription drugs are pretty intense and have pretty severe negative consequences, so this framework in that case would probably even yield that people with actual ADHD but mild forms shouldn’t have those drugs pushed on them either.	ethanbond	14.1664	4.1458006	comment	3.0	21.0	1667046158	-12.57981

Stimulant medication can be helpful for some people, but it's not the only way to treat ADHD. Having an ADHD diagnosis could help you choose appropriate therapy methods, self-help practices, and other self-improvement measures. Of course, an ADHD diagnosis isn't necessary to begin implementing better time management practices, so I'd suggest addressing any issues you might have with time management, time boxing, and organization whether or not you have an ADHD diagnosis.When it comes to stimulant medication anecdotes, it's important to separate them by how long the person has been taking the medication.

It is only saying that the idea that autism is On The Rise in a terrifying way, that it is something to be feared, is misguided.As this article says, and as the book Neurotribes explores in depth, autism used to have much more strict criteria for diagnosis. Connor, the leading researcher of autism for much of the 20th century, was convinced autism should only cover the most severe cases, and he did not like the spectrum idea.

19217025	One of the interesting problems with	One of the interesting problems with the medical model that emerged during our regular contact with it when our first kid was born is that medicine is intensely normative - that is, it assumes a median condition and looks for outliers that require correction. From a statistical and biological perspective this does not make sense. There is no underlying biological norm - variation is real (as in, our fundamental biology differs), and any normal behavior is merely the result of the central  limit theorem, etc. Defining this real variation as disordered seems a fundamental problem. This becomes particularly problematic when those norms are measured using a non-representative sample (e.g. white Americans) and applied to everyone else.	astazangasta	14.149798	4.1485505	comment	3.0	11.0	1550758965	-12.590522

There are a number of hypotheses out there for the disparity of prevalence.One hypothesis is that the disparity is more apparent than real: That girls are better at masking/adapting to their symptoms, and thus more frequently escape diagnosis. The first step is to determine the extent to which this is true. If true, the underlying mechanism would need to be understood...some have suggested this could be related to greater inter-hemispheric connectivity in girls.

If attention deficit is defined as a kid having trouble coping with the standard 7-hour school day (more like 9-10 including homework) where he is expected to sit still and work on boring and non-essential worksheets, then the condition isn't over diagnosed at all.And if we're not willing to change that environment--and I don't think we are--then we should medicate the kids so at least the experience is tolerable and they can have some success with it. Given that artificial stimulation to cope with the modern workforce is universal (espresso shots, liters of coffee, energy drinks), they might as well start getting used to it.	rayiner	14.157836	4.132759	comment	3.0	25.0	1471969717	-12.559653

Having ADHD, especially now that ADD is ADHD-PI, seems very normal these days, but it we treat it more like an affliction than a common behavior the modern world needs more compassion towards.If I have a child and they seem to have ADHD, I would pull them out of the public school system so as they don't have their time wasted and their esteem destroyed. If the system doesn't become more understanding, then it's up to me. At least then my child can be brought up to learn good coping mechanisms they'd be lucky to otherwise learn before it's too late.	ravenstine	14.171269	4.136566	comment	3.0	35.0	1543521775	-12.605322

Very often the difference between two very similar molecules is the difference between life and death (for a classic example, look up the two enantiomers of thalidomide).	epgui	14.10348	4.159327	comment	3.0	13.0	1703206793	-12.520724

Difficulty with understanding social cues and (these distinctions are also about creating distance) other people’s space is a typical trait of autism. These linguistic innovations wouldn't spread – and often quickly, within a couple of generations – if the neurotypical masses found them burdensome.I'm in a country with this distinction, too, and I don't like strangers addressing me with the informal just like that. Every sociolinguistic setting is different, but using just the informal might not automatically create rapport but the opposite.

Hans was autistic and had the mind blindness thing going on, which sometimes made social interaction difficult for him.  I think that most of my family did not want to believe that he killed his wife; and that some of his bizarre behavior could be explained by just not having that instinct that drives people to conform to social norms.

Assuming real examples of ADHD do in fact exist, massive levels of overdiagnosis are entirely possible.3) It's entirely possible that some people do find these drugs helpful in their day-to-day lives, even if they have nothing like 'clinical pathology' to excuse or justify their use of such substances.

Adderall’s active ingredient is amphetamine, a drug that functions in some ways like cocaine. Both deliver excess dopamine to the brain, enhancing motivation and concentration, and the cocainelike effect of stimulants is enhanced when they’re snorted. Hence the  long-standing nickname for Concerta and Ritalin: Diet Coke. “There is a fear that the overuse of prescribed amphetamines could lead to the equivalent of another opioid epidemic,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who served as the FDA’s principal deputy commissioner under Barack Obama.Concerta and Ritalin contain methylphenidate, not amphetamine.

Otherwise, people won’t get the help they need, and dumbasses will continue to revert to their tropes of “laziness”, “lack of willpower”, “bad parenting”, and “just need to put in more effort”.There’s a lot of confusion about what ADHD is and whether it exists at all.

Do we call this a disorder or a trait? Is having a brain structure outside of the median set of types a disorder?  Depending on the level of differences in the brain, one may be labelled as “Aspergers” and appear externally like everyone else, or on the other end of the scale, may need assistance with every day living. Neither disorder or trait captures nearly both ends of the scale.It’s probably also unhelpful to label someone with ‘asbergers’ as disordered.

Poor diversity in nutrition leads to poor biodiversity in the gut flora.That said, poor gut biodiversity could in turn lead to exacerbated presentation of symptoms, due to gut flora's involvement in neurotransmitter systems, interactions with the gut's nervous system, or simply painful intestinal distress.	gnode	14.265136	4.257209	comment	3.0	29.0	1559325516	-12.631732

People with this demeanor tend to gravitate very heavily towards engineering / technology related fields and excel, although I never understood why.The way I describe it to most people is very simple. If you give a ADD/ADHD child Ritalin, Adderol, etc, they will calm down. You give those drugs to a normal child and they get super hyperactive.

Maybe other people feel differently, but for me personally I think there’s a pretty clear difference. If I could take a magic pill that permanently cured my depression/anxiety/ADHD, I would. But my feelings toward autism are a lot more complicated. Despite making my life more difficult in some ways, it feels much more a part of who I am than the other conditions. If it suddenly disappeared it would completely change my personality and way of thinking, to the degree that I basically wouldn’t be the same person anymore.	belkinpower	14.269376	4.2308083	comment	3.0	23.0	1648851684	-12.647996

My point was that when a huge percentage of parents are “doing it wrong”, maybe there’s some wider systemic thing at play. Like economic forces that make people work harder than they should if they have kids, dissolution of support networks that would’ve normally cared for the kids in addition to the parents, etc. I’m not saying that this is a cause of ADHD, because I know little about it, but if you take their opinion as correct, then much of the blame could be laid at the societal structures we’ve created rather than the individual.	ericd	14.214086	4.1772356	comment	3.0	17.0	1655223491	-12.56808

I would be extremely cautious about prescribing this to anyone, especially children unless nearly every other kind of intervention has been explored.If you are a parent and considering Ritalin for your child, first ask yourself if you'd consider legal cocaine to be a reasonable solution for your child.

When I start a task that I typically struggle to hold my attention to, I start the app, and when I feel the vibration, I check off if I was on task or not.

I finally settled on “imagine going through life with this constant sound in the back of your head like a fuzzy AM radio station that you can never tune in and also can never just ignore killing any ability to focus. Taking the drug to treat it (time released methylphenidate in my case) allows me to tune that station in like it was a perfect CD with an amazing amp, or just shut it off all together like having the serenity of a quite room on top of a mountain.” Still not sure this example works, but it has improved my friends understanding.

Either we're screwing up the diagnostic criteria and overlabelling people (or worse, we're diagnosing them out of convenience), or we've seriously fucked our own society in ways that aggravate this, and medication is at best a stopgap.	esyir	14.168549	4.144595	comment	4.0	13.0	1617693215	-12.568427

Medication can help, but has its trade-offs and isn't a silver bullet.Self-discipline is also more costly. You can brute-force your way through tasks with ADHD, but it is more taxing on your overall energy. Those with ADHD typically experience impulses often and it's harder for them to ignore. Forcing yourself to ignore them requires extra energy. It's not sustainable to do all the time. It's hard for those without ADHD to truly understand what that's like.In addition to impulsivity, executive dysfunction affecting starting tasks or work is also a big challenge.	throwaway743950	14.171626	4.13653	comment	4.0	21.0	1680551622	-12.571336

That's like calling alcohol boring, maybe someone may not like the experience, but they both have immediate and noticeable effects and it's not just ""I love studying"" either.Even Scott's article has examples of this, here's a story of a little girl becoming very high from a prescription stimulant:""A spontaneous report from the manufacturer of Strattera (atomoxetine) described a 7-year-old girl who received 18 mg daily of atomoxetine for the treatment of ADHD.

If there are already 300 genes mapped which influence this handful of conditions, that implies that we already know of specific genes which effectively influence behavior by shifting psychology around these clusters.And since genes are heritable, this has consequences for groups of people and their interactions in greater society. This may be an unpleasant question but if research proceeds in this field it is one that will have to be answered.	twomoretime	14.218818	4.1796217	comment	4.0	30.0	1585433743	-12.601888

I've had a hard time understanding why it's so socially acceptable to wave a flag when convenient and stand up for justice when there's no scientific backing beyond the justification for homeopathic remedies. Society is a complex organism and while we are making inroads - not labeling people as witches and burning them alive - stumping for a wishy-washy grab-bag of symptoms to label a true disability is a pretty hard sell.

This information is separated, not connected.” It takes her so long to realize she is hungry that she often feels faint and gets something to eat only after someone suggests it to her.This sounds more like a failure to integrate sensory information than a predictive error.

The app isn’t called “meth” or “methamphetamine” and it’s not referring to a street drug.I’m saddened to see so many equating amphetamines to illicit drugs, when that’s simply not the full story.

25993058	Coffee consumption was actually one 	Coffee consumption was actually one of the questions that I was asked when my therapist first suspected that I had ADHD. I used to drink 5+ cups per day (especially workdays) while feeling fairly little effect from it. I'm now on medication which works an order of magnitude better for managing my symptoms, and I rarely drink more than 1 cup of coffee per day.It's also worth noting that ADHD often comes with other mental health comorbidities; in my case, it exacerbated my depression. I would often fall into a spiral of inability to focus -> feeling bad about myself for not completing work that I was generally more than capable of doing -> even less ability to focus. I still have depression, but starting on ADHD medication all-but-removed my most frequent trigger.	schneidmaster	14.154465	4.1390405	comment	4.0	16.0	1612209963	-12.566785

Some examples are listed on my patreon: https://www.patreon.com/shawwn but I feel silly bragging about comparatively minor accomplishments in ML.But I know for a fact that without adderall, I wouldn't have done a damn thing. I've tried for a few months. Shrugged and went back.Her flying to Nevada is completely understandable. CA pharmacies are some of the worst in terms of this medicine. I've experienced it firsthand.Is it so hard to believe that I'd probably be a potsmoker working at a grocery store if I hadn't had adderall? Not that there's anything wrong with potsmoking nor working at a grocery store, but it's not ML.I advise empathy. Try. 	sillysaurusx	14.1207	4.149962	comment	4.0	16.0	1607239982	-12.548532

"I have a number of thoughts on this.> If autism is the impaired ability to ascribe mental statesFirst, autism is not the impaired ability to ascribe mental states. Earlier in your post you more accurately described that as a symptom.There are attempted theories that get more to what autism ""is"", that it's a heavier weight on bottom-up processing, processing distinct details more and holistic things less. Another (congruent) idea is related to a ""narrow tunnel of attention"" and to using more of the brain to attend to a more narrow set of stimuli and thoughts. (You can look up monotropism for more info on this idea.)Secondly, in my experience and others I've read - autistic individuals seem to often do much better at understanding each other.

Next thing to go is healthy eating; you simply don't need to eat when under the influence, or you do -- but you forget.

The distortion most likely originates from the first relationship, i.e. the relationship to the mother. Since there is a need for a fulfilled relationship, it will be fulfilled by one way or another. If e.g. the mother is absent, then the mind looks for another way to fulfil it.One way for fulfilment is becoming the desired object itself.

She simply argues that the symptoms are caused by numerous unknown diverse causes in the brain, and the concept of a single disorder (ASD), or even a spectrum of related disorders (ASDs, the DSM-IV PDDs, and more recent ASD sub-typing proposals), isn't helpful in understanding those causes.

It could be that you missed diagnoses at a young age due to being intelligent enough to cruise through school and university with little effort, so your problem was never picked up as you never suffered any serious negative effects from ADHD due to your intelligence and ability to get tasks done quickly.That's basically what happened to me. I'd be able to do an assignment that would take people several days, in half a day.

It is a real disorder, but it’s challenging to understand and diagnose because it’s basically an extreme version of experiences and troubles that most people have.

31229862	ADHD is a common condition in adults	"ADHD is a common condition in adults, estimated to be around 3-5% of the population. It's very frequently comorbid with other behavioral disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, etc. But even ""pure"" ADHD can be quite disadvantageous. People with ADHD are much less likely to finish school, have trouble staying employed, more likely to be divorced, have greater health care utilization among other adverse outcomes.Despite these factors only 20% of ADHD individuals receive treatment which can make a big difference. Medications can be helpful but are not by any means a ""cure"". Rather specific behavioral therapies are a necessary part of an effective treatment program.As a physician specializing in behavioral health, I've treated a great number of ADHD adults.

This is part of what keeps us frozen. Why would we want to enter a task that will continue to feel overwhelming indefinitely. This is why pomodoro and other strategies that clearly define the end are so effective. It allows us to offboard the clock management part of it that is so difficult.

But Lance can take drugs to get more of the biking time and less of the recovering time. This is how SPD and ADHD work. ADHD is just a medicated false mask that a schizoid person can maintain for longer periods of time than usual, without episodes of hermitude to recharge. They're doping.Failure to maintain the mask looks like a breakdown in attention/focus. People do long, focused work because of the expectations of others.

Often, the doctor's client is actually the amphetamine derivative supplier, and the product being sold (on a commission basis) is the patient.Amphetamine addiction results in the patient feeling bad when they run out of their powerful stimulant drugs, and the resulting feelings of malaise tend to confirm the patient's belief that they have a neurological disorder (rather than just suffering from the standard set of problems that come with regular amphetamine use).	photochemsyn	14.155308	4.14476	comment	5.0	28.0	1664897141	-12.570034

The autistic person I had to deal with a lot of times had ""difficulty"" with social cues in that he was an adult that had no idea of not standing by others when they were working, would endlessly repeat things, was more or less impossible to hold a conversation with, etc. We more or less had to babysit him as impromptu caretakers.It isn't ""oh, I don't know how to read a room."" Even granting high function, I feel people use autism in the same way as they do OCD; it's not something you use ""neurodivergent"" with seriously.Like generally there's a lot of disability chic or identity these days; but moderate autism makes it incredibly hard to act in daily life in the same way moderate OCD does.

In my junior year of high school, they switched classes to 90 minutes, you took different classes on different days, and none of my classes included physical activities. My grades plummeted after the switch, and I ended up getting diagnosed with ADD when I was struggling with college in my mid-20s.	hn8788	14.175603	4.1403184	comment	5.0	19.0	1621267369	-12.59617

People with autism may be a minority, and that makes the condition abnormal, but in itself autism isn't a bad thing; it's how they relate to the world that make autism ""bad."" Instead autism is merely different.I think we can treat autism like any other subject. For example, some children start reading earlier than others, and other than extreme cases we don't say that they have a reading disorder. We simply recognize that some people have more difficulty than others learning to read. Can we do the same with social skills? Simply have a dedicated class with structured learning, and recognize that not everyone learns social cues at the same rate?"	ranger207	14.2842	4.2363553	comment	5.0	17.0	1566316049	-12.6801

Solving for serotonin is simple and the results are crystal clear. So it seems many of the medications attempt to adjust for both with various degrees of success.

Since then the use of using various pharmaceutical stimulants has become extremely widespread - jumping up by multiple orders of magnitude.I'm unsure what the latest numbers are but they offer the data to 2013. And just between 2008 and 2013 adult usage of ADHD medication doubled. It was at 2.8% and has likely continued to rapidly increase. That's completed dwarfed by what we're now doing to kids and particularly boys.	TangoTrotFox	14.156858	4.141561	comment	6.0	21.0	1543527803	-12.568127

His condition was already obvious by then. “He was lining things up, switching lights on and off, on and off,” says his mother, Melissa. He was bright, but he didn’t speak much until age 3, and he was easily frustrated. Once he started school, he couldn’t sit still in class, called out answers without raising his hand and got visibly upset when he couldn’t master a math concept or a handwriting task quickly enough.

31741671	As the parent of a child with ADHD t	As the parent of a child with ADHD that is medicated, it seems completely plausible that it could cause depression. When my kid has had too high a dosage (or accidentally takes a double dose) she's like a zombie, completely flat affect, and very little motivation. It's like it drains her life away.Part of the problem is that it's very difficult to get the right dosage for any given day because diet, metabolism, and hormones seem to have a big impact on how effective it is. We've found it's better to go with a lower-dose extended release, and then let her self-medicate with 5mg regular tablets as needed. This works great now because she's a fairly responsible teenager (when medicated), but it was really hard when she was younger.	jobu	14.14798	4.142054	comment	6.0	32.0	1655223699	-12.570506

There’s no escaping society’s judgment though.

The scheduler is designed to consider all tasks, but will give a higher priority to tasks that provide immediate feedback.A consequence of this design is that tasks which require a lot of time to complete, but provide little to no feedback until after the task is completed, are typically starved for resources. Often, they will never complete, or even start running.Well, that's basicall	echlebek	14.152156	4.129189	comment	9.0	52.0	1521307715	-12.55298

That's the real problem with being disabled: you're treated abnormally.Sure, there will always be exceptions, but just recognize humans are not fungible, and be kind.

* Pattern-match past situations onto the present situation to guide your current response
* Mentally tell yourself what to do and have it stick
* Manage your emotions towards your long-term interests
* Imagine and evaluate multiple possible future outcomesThere are other ways to describe it - e.g. I didn't mention short-term memory - but this is the flavor.ASD is completely different.

Most people do not enjoy focusing on a single activity for most of their waking hours. Someone who consistently practices a craft for 8 hours a day would accumulate >10,000 hours in just 4 years, sufficient to become an expert in most non-professional activites. Within 15 years, such focus would yield >40,000 hours which is more than the actual practice time most professionals have under their belt.

Humans are capable of being good judges of interpersonal compatibility, and the best interviewers employ an appropriate amount of intuition in the process because only a limited interaction is possible and every bit of information available deserves to have some chance of being factored into the assessment.Let's face it: for neurotypical people, a lot of autists are very hard to get along with.

In the time between the first and second attempt, I developed PTSD which essentially stalled the second diagnostic as they could not cleanly differentiate between the two. For some reason, getting a diagnosis has been nearly impossible for me, despite each diagnostician saying ""ADHD is highly likely"", and the PTSD was a downstream effect of untreated ADHD.I'm curious of any other developers have found effective, non-medication based ways to manage this."	icepat	14.17103	4.139002	comment	11.0	54.0	1700048997	-12.605123

But if anyone reading this identifies with this sort of chronic procrastination, consider seeking psychiatric help. This is a giant red flag for adult ADHD, which is a serious and often misunderstood issue, and one of the few psychiatric diagnoses for which there is solid treatments (stimulants) with near universal efficacy and very few side effects. Getting on Adderall, then Vyvanse changed my life for the better, and basically solved this issue overnight, as well as a bunch of other benefits.	kobeya	14.156812	4.1297493	comment	11.0	95.0	1506065997	-12.579571

This is gentler and shows a degree of deference and courtesy from the person with authority to the other person.A blunt ""no"" effectively comes across as a rejection of that olive branch-- I think that's where the initial internal panic comes from.

There are two dimensions to empathy, cognitive and affective. Cognitive is more about perspective taking, or reading the feelings / intentions of others, while affective is the ability to share/understand the emotions of others, and respond appropriately.Putting aside that the two may overlap, it's often the cognitive aspect that challenges the autistic, leaving them susceptible to being tricked, or unable to pick up on, say, whether or not a person is interested in dating them.I point this out b/c it's important that this deficiency isn't construed as simply a predisposition to acting like an unfeeling jerk.

Ignore the people screaming about Adderall being ""literal meth"" and how it will certainly kill you.

It plays into the motivation of most stimulant users which is that the stimulants have given them a special cheat code in life.I worked in construction in my younger years and saw this kind of attitude from the occasional meth user on the jobsite. I'm seeing more coherent echoes of it in this thread.

A software solution won't fix this. What ADHD people need isn't a normie couch to tell them to 'prioritize' differently or a bunch of shitty checkboxes to tick off. They need a licensed psychiatrist to prescribe stimulants which are effective for treating up to 85% of suffers. This service is exploitative, idiotic, uninformed, and deeming.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, the key is that developmental disorders occur over the time-course of typical development. To have a diagnosis of ADHD, there must have been symptoms before the age of 7, and furthermore, it's much more likely to occur in younger children because their executive functions are less well developed.On the neurological level, there are different dopaminergic systems developing throughout childhood, such as the motor cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the dopamine-based reward system. If the motor cortex develops too quickly before the PFC, which controls/regulates behavior, well you'll have hyperactivity that's unregulated.

This is OPT OUT, not opt in. In other reviews they say they will offer a refund (I will update when/if I get one) but for an app for people with executive function issues, an opt out format seems shady. Either way, I won't be purchasing this for my loved one with the opt out format for payment.> They exploit the same vulnerability of the patients, they aim to cure! They take you in confidence and then charge you after the trial ends. ADHD folks forget things all the time and it's a challenge for them. An email reminder is not going to cut it.

Reading a book, reading a paper, etc -- these activities take discipline that most people don't develop or don't often apply. This isn't new. The mistake is thinking that the ability to concentrate on something non-entertaining is the baseline. One reason so many people think they have ADHD is because they make that mistake.We had the same anxieties about radio and TV. Those anxieties were right and wrong.

So for about 22 years I've coped with ADHD without meds. I am a Staff Engineer and make a good living, respected in my field.Regardless of anything else, I think the key thing to remember about ADHD is that you do not need to be a high-performing human being, at all, in life. You will forget things and get distracted and not get as much done. So what. You are still intelligent and caring and dedicated and responsible and a hard worker. You probably put more effort in (when you get around to it) than many others without the condition. And you will do about as well as everyone else, on average. And this is fine. Do not put pressure on yourself to live up to what someone else can do. O	throwawaaarrgh	14.171991	4.134662	comment	21.0	249.0	1668654593	-12.598113

I was never diagnosed as a child because I largely functioned as a kid and was quiet and non-disruptive, but looking back the signs were all there.Fast forward as an adult I have a number of coping mechanisms and one of them is to have something on in the background. I have never associated the effectiveness with the noise itself, but rather with something that is keeping part of my brain quiet. It prevents my mind from wandering. It is ideally something I already know. Like a show I have seen before or a podcast that I am okay not fully retaining. Not enough stimulation and I get distracted easily, too much stimulation and I shut down completely. Music doesn't usually work for me.	etempleton	14.160776	4.128697	comment	21.0	154.0	1669000302	-12.566312

I can't at all imagine identifying with the sentiment, ""Nothing is wrong with me, I’m just autistic,"" as one of the women in the article says.  When I go to a party with my girlfriend, I want to come off well, if only for her sake, and I would like to have some interesting conversations, and maybe (very optimistically) to meet someone I can share an interest with, since some interests can only be pursued in a very limited way by one's self.  I would like to become closer to people I find interesting or admirable.  I would like to be able to offer people the pleasure and comfort of a friendly greeting and conversation.

Anyway, I can't help thinking that ADHD is one of those mental disorders that merely reflects some increased demands of society rather than a genuine mental disorder and that people with ADHD are just part of the natural variation of different personality types.There also seems to be a huge divide between the US and Europe, where such disorders seem to be diagnosed way less often. It has always appeared to me that many people in the US are more easily considered mentally ill when they do not fully conform to society's expectations, and at the same time the people who suffer from severe mentally illness are less cared for in the US than in Europe. Or maybe that's just how the media portray it.	jonathanstrange	14.177301	4.1426697	comment	24.0	132.0	1557736444	-12.604891

It was very comforting to know others struggle with this and this book helps you to be ok with it. I wouldn’t say it “cured” me but I think about it differently now and use it more to my advantage. Worth a read at a minimum.There was one very profound idea in this book that goes like this:“If you are no longer interested in a project you started, maybe you already got what you came for”.In essence, maybe it’s not the finishing of the project you came for but maybe the learning or understanding of how it could be done if it were to be done.This realization is interesting for someone	ryeguy_24	14.165912	4.122799	comment	25.0	139.0	1586176591	-12.599437

I've spoken with many people on stimulants, and none of them enjoy taking the medication, beyond what it has done to improve their lives. Furthermore, most ADHD people develop tolerance to medication over long periods of time -- eventually the drug does little-to-nothing itself. For myself, taking even high doses of a Adderall regularly produces no result -- might as well be taking sugar pills.
