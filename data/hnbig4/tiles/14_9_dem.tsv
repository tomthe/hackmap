A related result from the neutron star collision is that the speed of light and the speed of gravity are the same, to within something like 1 part in 10^15.

So 2% is huge.Our sun moves about the Milky Way at 828,000mph.2% of the speed of light is around 13,000,000mphThat's the speed where relativistic effects become important.		JoeAltmaier
