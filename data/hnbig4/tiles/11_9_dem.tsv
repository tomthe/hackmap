But sounds like you’re gonna have a hard time staying ahead of abuse. Not to mention attracting enough people for the app to be useful is gonna be difficult if you’re not spending money on marketing.Maybe you could have a monthly fee? But then who’s gonna use it? And there’s already plenty of established sites like that.Well maybe you could have a virtual equivalent of buying someone a drink? Ah yes, we end up back on roses.  Is it perfect? No. But doesn’t sound like any option is.	serjester	7.404503	2.4160028	comment	3.0	10.0	1664817983	-4.2464857

You could answer none of them, or you could answer 100 of them, and the more you answered, the more confidence it had in its matching.  You would even flag the importance of each question, so you can tell it if something is an absolute deal-breaker (like your desire to have kids or stay child-free), or if something is a mild preference, like hair color.> (for example, if their entire model is based on superficial values like how well they can take a photo of themselves - it may not be good at actually matching people)IMO, Tinder ruined online dating.

When people came of age in this utopia, they would be paired off through what they would be told is a random lottery.In reality, however, the city's leaders would decide on the couplings ahead of time, pairing like with like.

And it's not really feasible for the dating site distinguish between ""will successfully date for a few months"" and ""will successfully date for a lifetime"".You could apply the same logic to any long term purchase.

Any mental illness that is not genetic and which develops due to external causes can be cured. There are many personality disorders, of which NPD is one. While there is no single cure for NPD, in fact NPD can be cured in many cases in one of two ways. Some can be cured relatively quickly with an antidepressant, which eliminates the symptoms, but most with NPD can either mitigate the disorder or completely cure it though talk therapy generally in under two years. It's absolutely true that one can learn to stop being an asshole.	Maursault	7.444708	3.5680199	comment	3.0	13.0	1666033406	-4.5956335

If the claim is true that in 10 years no parent following Sprott's method have had a case of SIDS (which no-one seemed to follow up on, even though the study seems quite solid to me), then the counter would have to explain why one should wait instead of just adopting that method. It seems a similar story to Beri-Beri in the Japanese Navy pre-WW2 - one doctor just went and found a cure in the field and everyone else just ignored it because his methods were not proven in a clinical study and because the cure required a change of traditional warrior behaviour.[1] http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13590840400016836[2]

Although the United States embarked on a famine relief program in the Soviet Union in the early 1920s and American businessmen established commercial ties there during the period of the New Economic Policy (1921–29), the two countries did not establish diplomatic relations until 1933.

Just now VK Group announced their in-home game engine will be based on this code.I can guess that Gaijin Entertainment had some contracts with companies in Russia, but after moving their business out of Russia it's now easiest way to fulfill the terms of some IP licensing deal.Yandex is doing the same thing, but other way around by releasing more and more of their code as open source.

While men may barely get any attention, women get too much and have to bomb through a lot to basically find the needle in the haystack.
Another thing I find interesting about dating apps is that almost all dating apps are owned and operated by Match Group Inc. (even on an international level). I have long had a running joke with my friends that if we ever want to get semi-rich we just have to create a mediocre dating app and have it bought up by Match Group.

It's because they weren't capable of understanding the dire economic need for oil and were too zoned in on their domain of expertise (military engagement). Hitler for all his faults was one of the few who knew that the only important stratetic objective at that point was oil. He failed to get a number of his generals on that same understanding, and in some cases these generals sabotaged the oil effort.	fighterpilot	6.524385	2.8208306	comment	3.0	15.0	1622491363	7.58959

Elizabeth Holmes was a rich asshole (who is guilty mainly of defrauding other rich assholes). But let's not let our incarceration policy be guided solely by our preconceptions, which are often heavily biased, influenced, and even misinformed.

One area was that it was actually pushing to change laws (I know it did this in Arizona) to give individual control over blood testing instead of requiring people to go through doctors and corporations. Another area was price transparency. Much like the Surgery Center of Oklahoma (https://surgerycenterok.com), it was listing all the prices for its tests right there on its website.

I think it was at least 10 in a few hours. However, it quickly faded, and after a few days, I was lucky to receive one message a day.

Almost every day you can read in the news on the new plan of USA/NATO/GB to start a war with Russia.So, all the news, all the books, all the history you get on the West is dedicated to one thing: paint Russia and Russians as the most evil savages, the history of Russia as a bloody bloodbath, etc, etc.There's simply 	anticodon	6.408994	2.8128598	comment	3.0	13.0	1628075567	8.28683

If you inject test (the most basic anabolic steroid) then in order to maintain a sort of homeostasis, your body will lower its natural test production. The same goes for any other anabolic steroid, as they are all test derivatives.As a result, when you end your cycle, your body needs to restart its natural test production. There can be a delay while this happens and it leads to unpleasant, though temporary, side effects, like weight gain and a loss of sexual appetite. This can be mitigated somewhat by taking estrogen regulators such as Clomid, which is a prescription drug for women.Anyway, the upshot of all this is injecting steroids in men is sort of complicated.

Therefore it was an inside threat.Proof by narrative is the slippery slope whereby the state becomes a religion.It's borrowed from religion and used in the modern state.  In the old testament, whenever the chosen people were defeated, the only reason could be that someone was making sacrifices to the wrong god somewhere.  The proof was that god would have been with them on the battlefield otherwise.It's why, in Stalinist show trials, political enemies are made to confess for crimes of sabotaging production, because the narrative says that the production process is perfect in the Soviet Union and the only way that quotas would fail to be met is be	narrator	6.691319	2.3875854	comment	3.0	31.0	1471884881	8.304835

The state itself is more of a gangster than a state in the European / American sense:Many businesses in the Russian Federation avoid taxes by using offshore jurisdictions, such as Cyprus, for their headquarters. Rich Russians, meanwhile, often funnel their private fortunes offshore, in an effort to hide their assets from the capricious and predatory Russian state.Going round Russian restrictions seems if anything to be positive: When the rules themselves are wrong one should not feel bad violating them.The other day in response to an HN comment I dug up this link: http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/342719	jseliger	6.357334	2.819799	comment	3.0	19.0	1471989177	8.363891

Of course, you've never heard about that, but you've heard about Putin recently supporting some right-wing groups. Could it be because one benefits the political narrative of most journalists but the other does not?Putin uses his propaganda machine to support whatever he thinks serves his interests at that time. This year it's a soft-on-Russia Trump. A few years before, it was the soft-on-Russia Democrats. I promise it'll never be Mitt Romney or John McCain though.And in general, it's a little amusing seeing the American Left suddenly discover this year that they are anti-Russian cold-warriors, after decades of being the exact opposite.	wildmusings	6.4200826	2.6288886	comment	3.0	11.0	1472270839	8.384427

Current emissions are more than 25% below 1990 levels - can you say such thing about America, China or India?

Think of DNA as a couple long strings (Number of bases is effectively the character count of those strings, each string is a ""chromosome"" in higher organisms), so the problem is how do we read these long, physical strings.  It turns out that parallel processing is way more effective, so we break the really long strings into much, much smaller strings that overlap (Millions of characters long to hundreds often).  Because the strings overlap, we can  construct a good portion of the actual sequence computationaly by exploiting this overlapping feature of our small strings.The physical way they do this is by using machines (Think GPU vs CPU) that are effectively a bunch of parallel microscopes specialized"	alextheparrot	7.502682	3.4070308	comment	3.0	13.0	1484932552	-5.2757792

- When women breastfeed, they get some hormone that can put them into REM sleep way faster.
- Men are not as sensitive for sounds during their sleep as women.So evolution wise, this was probably mainly a mothers sacrifice.

It's about transfers of funds from Russia to foreign bank (and ""bank-like"") accounts.

An assistant or VA is often the POC when the job posting is copy&pasted into the job board. This can be overcome, but it's challenge to try to reeducate the organization.2. Chicken-egg Problem: The challenging part here is that your racing against many existing players with large audiences, and hoping that they can't reverse-engineer the solution before you catch up.3.

More than any other leader of the 19th or 20th century, he held the whole thing together almost singlehandedly.  He had to because he got rid of people so regularly that there was no one else who had been there long enough to even know how to run things.The other interesting thing about studying Stalin is that very few people liked him enough to hide his dirty laundry after he died.

Now it's women's responsibility to avoid that, and they do so by being very selective with who they swipe on. As another commenter said, only the top percentage of men will regularly get matches while majority of women will easily match.

I imagine in the USSR it could have been dangerous to talk to children like that and one way out was to exaggerate the stories until the child notices what's going on.

I also loved the fact it was dripping with deadpan sarcasm and irony. A wonderful response for the powerless to take given the Kafkaesque situations that people found themselves in under Stalinism.

The problem is that most people wants to trade up, and few people (on dating sites) have the desire to end up with someone their own score.  Fewer yet wants to date someone less attractive.

Later, they are awake frequently for feeding or otherwise, which is also difficult.  Once they settle into a routine, however, it's fine.I would particularly advise the ""cry it out"" technique.

It's analogies are pretty solid, even if they are just analogies.  It's a well-described snapshot of the early phase of education where this helps build a grand intuition and relations between disciplines. Just be careful to remember that they're just analogies, and in general can't be relied on to actually discover, invent, design or conclude.The fun part for everyone here is that the science has improved so far so quickly that at this point that we are starting to be able to improve, implement and otherwise make good on those coding-style capabilities.

For production genome sequencing centers though, Illumina's still the dominant tech.

I stayed in the Kadıköy and Sultanahmet districts, and it was so incredible to walk through a society which had been Monkey Patched through millennia. The runtime behavior of the objects, streets, buildings and the city had been adapted time and time again. Roman temples becoming Churches becoming Mosques becoming Museums, sometimes simply with some new tiles or a freshly laid down carpet. Each layer rich in artifacts. My favorite attraction was the Great Palace Mosaics Museum, some of the most detailed and vibrant mosaics I had ever seen.

A lot of school districts re-use the same buses to pick up students from different schools: first the high schoolers, then the middle schoolers, and finally the elementary schoolers.Not sure what the solution they are suggesting here. Triple the number of buses and bus drivers on the road? Let high schoolers sleep in so that grade schoolers can stand on dark streets at 7:30am? Have grade schoolers stay home until 10:30am stay at school until evening?Also, having been a teenager [citation needed], I have strong doubts about the ""the science"" as presented.

There’s just endless complexity there.There’s 574 amino acids making four separate interlocking chains in a single globin, plus the heme, all just to bind 4 oxygen molecules. It’s simultaneously elegant but hugely complex, far above any discussion of the rna sequencing.It’s a big part of the “gap” between chemistry and biology IMO.	ip26	7.237101	3.5719552	comment	3.0	16.0	1657382703	-7.399693

Recombination and deletion would then have pruned down the disordered parts to leave more efficient smaller proteins.No idea if that idea makes sense or has any research behind it, but it's quite a neat theory.	gilleain	7.2297077	3.5912104	comment	3.0	12.0	1657383515	-7.403527

The Russians have a tradition of releasing technology without giving a lot of worry about what happens to it, for better or for worse.

But the fact of the matter is, babies throughout history have slept—and in many places today, still sleep—in the same “bed” as their parents. Various positions of sleeping (back, side, stomach) are also common across cultures and time.At the risk of being one of those parents who don't want to hear a counterargument…Sure, this is all true, but the author's argument is unsatisfying. We've done lots of things throughout history that have since been proven unsafe. Putting babies on their back to sleep is correlated with a 50% reduction in SIDS deaths.

Who's to say there aren't others that he's handed off to various federal prosecutors like at SDNY or EVDA? Assuming that Mueller has entirely cleared the president (or anyone around him) at this point is about as pointless as proving he's about to be arrested in the Oval Office.Let it play out and see what happens.

I disagree. That observation says, to me, that the men competing in these events are not as well trained, not as experienced.Look at the men's marathon and you'll see everyone taking it easy at the beginning of the race!

It's a horrible way to meet people. Young people's inability to approach potential partners the old school way has been a boon for those who actually have the balls to do so. I face so little competition these days, it's become real easy to stand out from the pack and get everything I want, more often than not.	kenneth	7.4358106	2.401712	comment	3.0	19.0	1605163015	-4.2402616

You’ll get a match...Bumble is definitely more popular among my female friends. There are a lot of “fake” profiles too, profiles created with the intention of getting you to follow their Instagram, but there are real profiles out there with real people on the other side. Bumble is one of the many dating apps I tried after my divorce and it’s the one I have the most success with. I’m not a model so Tinder doesn’t work. I’m not interested in diving into another marriage so eharmony and hinge don’t work.

The rot is starting in the periphery with the lack of opportunity or prosperity in rural America.

She lost big enough to unambiguously have lost (unlike Gore in Bush v. Gore), but did not lose with a large enough margin to produce an easily identifiable single reason for losing. Thus, every single explanation for the loss seems somewhat valid.So, like anybody who is faced with choosing between ""this my own fault"" and ""someone else screwed me"", Democrats are choosing option B.

Applying air power to kill until capitulation was the basis of strategy.A common belief among the Air Force leadership was that nuclear weapons were a wasting asset that would be rendered moot once the Soviets were able to build out their arsenal. At the particular point in time, the US had an overwhelming superiority that was shrinking. There was a serious belief the preemptive war was critical while the window of superiority was open.

These authors have engineered a pretty clever system for tracking when brain cells exchange these vesicles.First they insert two genes into mice. The first is called tdTomato and is a red fluorescent protein. Crucially, they insert this gene backwards. I’ll explain that in a second.

It’s one of those topics where everybody thinks they’re the exception who will avoid the consequences, but do it long enough and it will happen.There are also a lot of secondary effects that people underestimate.

Skripals' poisoning had a very similar progression (the two targets survived after a coma [0], another inadvertently exposed person survived, one has died). Most anecdotes about Novichok's incredible lethality are stories out of Russia where use of Novichok was merely alleged. It's weird they'd botch 2 high profile assassination attempts like this if upping the dose a bit guarantees death.[0] I'm not too familiar with the exact mechanism that induces the coma. But common sense would tell me extended comas after which the patient makes a full recovery are an unusual phenomenon medically. Navalny's doctors seemed pretty unsure about his prospects too.

Literally thousands of people in online communities had undiagnosed Low Testosterone. Most docs are uneducated about this as they just look at the blood test lab results, and group everyone from age 20 to age 70 in the same category.

For example, many people self-diagnose as having various thyroid disorders based on vague symptoms (or WebMD, etc) but won’t let go of the diagnosis when all of their thyroid tests come back perfectly normal. This leads to weird social media bubbles where people insist the tests are wrong and start sourcing their own medications, with predictably bad results.Low testosteron	PragmaticPulp	7.4489555	3.4861062	comment	3.0	11.0	1652758395	-1.4760705

The amount of money inserted into the US economy dwarfs that of the TARPP and related bailouts of 2008 by a factor of 4.

Current dating sites are not the last word. Better ones will appear. But anyone who wants to start a dating startup has to answer two questions: in addition to the usual question about how you're going to approach dating differently, you have to answer the even more important question of how to overcome the huge chicken and egg problem every dating site faces.

One week we are told Trump fired Comey to stop the investigation on his ties to Russia. To be honest, I had a hard time swallowing that a thing like that hinged on 1 person at the FBI. But now if you read all these papers they are saying Trump is in for it because Robert Mueller is named special council in the Trump/Russia investigation. So the investigation goes on, even though last week it wasn't supposed to according to the same sources.That leads me to the other recent thing regarding the Comey memo. The FBI (Comey) cleared Flynn January 24th but this ""memo"" says Trump asked Comey in mid-February to let Flynn go.

Although humans have evolved far more than most animals on this planet, the basic idea of evolutionary biology remains the same. In the wild, males have to hunt (provide food), protect the new born(s) and their mate(s) from threats. Therefore having the same level or higher levels of Testosterone is a biological imperative. Testosterone makes the male stronger and more aggressive. Both are very useful traits from an evolutionary standpoint. I cannot imagine human males diverging too much from this basic framework.Coming to today's workplace, after childbirth there is a drop in productivity of male employees as they adjust to their new reality.

That's a lot of jobs, a lot of cash for a developing nation with low levels of education and skills.The fact that their newly opened Istanbul Airport will, once completed, have an annual capacity of 200 million passengers indicates Turkey's ambition was to keep their tourist industry growing as fast as possible.The national flag carrier, Turkish Airlines, with 315 scheduled destinations, was the largest mainline carrier in the world by number of passenger destin	WordSkill	6.7583222	3.1087472	comment	3.0	30.0	1596239415	9.007098

However with hindsight we now know the real plan of the Soviet Union - it never was to help Europe, but to conquer it. So in conclusion the US government helped us more (and not just during the war), while the SU government sent more people to die for their shady goals here. Nobody is discounting the heroism of the individual soldiers. The sad thing is that the current Russian government is using their legacy to pursue their shady goals again.

He would pass outside a designated bakery at exactly 7:24 a.m. local time. If he saw Gordievsky standing outside the bakery holding a grocery bag, it meant that the double agent was requesting to be exfiltrated as a matter of urgency. Gordievsky would then have to wait outside the bakery until a second MI6 officer appeared, carrying a bag from the Harrods luxury department store in London. The man would also be carrying a Mars bar (a popular British candy bar) and would bite into it while passing right in front of Gordievsky. That would be a message to him that his request to be exfiltrated had been received.https://intelnew	stordoff	6.524114	2.5825527	comment	3.0	21.0	1596913618	8.247613

There's some, but extremely limited, modeling of unknown states. The major breakthrough for AlphaFold appears to be that it is substantially better at detecting meaningful signal in homology-based sequence alignments.

From linked paper:> ""Although some of the sex differences arise from hormonal effects (Gurvich et al., 2018), it is now acknowledged that many differences are due to sex chromosome complement (Arnold, 2012).

The current brands of values and socialist morals were rationalized in the Central Committee, then propagated through Republics committees, then oblasts and regions down to town administrations into individual organizations, factories and schools (and sometimes police stations).In other words it was very much the opposite direction. Now you can liken woke culture to mob rule (tho I think that'd be exaggerating) or whatever, point is it's nothing like the Soviet system.	varjag	6.5534744	2.7223861	comment	4.0	41.0	1616237742	7.9339423

It does encode information in the sequence of base pairs, this is true. But it is also a physical structure in its own right, and properties of that structure incidental to the encoded information have what recently looks to be at least as important a role in the process of transcription as the sequence itself.There are, for example, some sequences which will cause a ribosome to transcribe the surrounding genes differently or with varying frequency, due to the physical interaction between the molecules involved.

Not to mention the pressure of finding common interests and cultivating a date experience. The group dynamic offers safety, and the hobby-focused nature of the activity offers entertainment without pressure.	CameronNemo	7.5321536	2.3790603	comment	4.0	13.0	1623443738	-4.0879693

The company previously said the success of The League’s high-price subscription made Match Group rethink how it could address “high-intent users” on its other apps like Tinder.OK, that makes sense.

Once users are addicted, you can play with their emotions by messing with the volatility and frequency of their rewards.

Usually they only do so when they don't think they will be paid, they have been asked by the company to do something unethical, or when they believe that their actions during the company's downfall may expose their own firm to liability.  In this case it may be a combination of the three, but whatever happened, Theranos is toast and I suspect Elizabeth Holmes will be very lucky if she does not spend some time in prison over this.	downandout	7.184769	2.9067347	comment	4.0	109.0	1480036242	15.110604

While I had some challenges growing up (nobody knew why I did the things I did) I can't say it was as bad as this recounting.  I am a bit younger though (33).  I do agree that most people just think of Tourette's as uncontrollable swearing since that's mainly how it's represented on TV.  It sucks, but I'm lucky that it's relatively mild and people I know don't seem to be bothered by it.  I think it's very hard for many people to understand because it's so hard to put into words.  Many people think it's involuntary, but when you tell them that it's in fact voluntary, but compulsory they tend to downplay it and wonder why you just don't stop.

13058759	400M isn't that much.  Per Glassdoor	400M isn't that much.  Per Glassdoor Theranos has 790 employees; assuming that was before layoffs and the numbers in the news (~340 layoffs) are accurate, that's 450.  Since it's an R&D company in Palo Alto, average total comp is likely north of $250k per person, but even at that it's $110M a year in payroll alone.   And medical research isn't exactly cheap, I bet it easily spends over $100M in research costs.  So at that burn rate Theranos has 2 years to keep the lights on. It takes more than 2 years for a medical company to bring a new product to market.Go ahead, halve all my numbers and argue that Theranos actually has a burn rate of 4 years:  It still doesn't matter, there is no way they'll get something through the FDA (especially given recent history) in 4 years.

When your population has a mix of well-off people and very poor people, and you provide super-cheap housing, the very poor people gravitate to it, among them those who are desperate, have nothing to lose, involved in drugs and crime, etc.Once this happens the crime rate goes up, the area feels unsafe to 'normal' people, and anyone who can do so gets the hell out of there. The area turns into a slum and is basically impossible to 'fix' without redeveloping it.I'd guess that in Russia, one of two things happens. Either Russia's wealth distribution is even enough under communism that the rot never sets in, or in practice they're just as much of a slum as the American ones and we're just seeing a romanticized view.	taneq	6.5944242	2.7958615	comment	4.0	23.0	1484113131	7.938082

Is it that talented people are more prone to depression (e.g. due to social isolation) or that their depression channels into existential/philosophical more often (this sounds even more plausible)? In both cases, I would love to see some numbers.The only thing I know that might support a link thinker-depressed is this one:

I had always heard this explained as fundamentalists leaving Turkey because its secular laws were more restrictive (e.g. headscarfs are banned in universities[0] because of the strong separation of church and state) and Erdogan catering towards those fundamentalists.I don't know what changed in Turkey but it now seems that his support has grown not only outside the country but also within and he seems to be hellbent on exploiting religion to gain political support. I don't know whether he actually holds fundamentalist views himself but he certainly knows how to use them to his advantage.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headscarf_controversy_in_Turke...	pluma	6.7584043	3.106781	comment	4.0	18.0	1469019301	9.058523

Around 1995-2005, Turkey was growing economically, a civil society was taking root and the people had an optimistic outlook friendly to the west. Erdogan was a mildly-religious fan of the EU and keen on economic progress in his first years.I'm not saying that Turkey was ready for membership back then, but it became pretty clear that it wasn't a lack of democracy or poverty that was the main hinderance of turkish membership: there were just too many EU countries (and you only need one) that Turkey just had an inacceptable ratio of churches to mosques.Around election-time EU leaders would conveniently drop most pretenses and admit 	matt4077	6.7474303	3.1054773	comment	4.0	17.0	1469019335	9.051738

For some reason criminals think small countries are safe, but capturing criminals like this, that are most wanted by the US, is a huge political win for the small countries, (brownie points with the US) and they will do whatever it takes to get them.Best countries to hide are larger countries that are not fully US aligned (think Brazil), or US hostile (Russia, etc)	ardit33	6.653695	2.9311655	comment	4.0	14.0	1679589920	8.547083

Scams happen all the time, and at the end of the day the crime was to have taken $700M in investments based on a lie.  I mean, that's, like, really bad.  But be real: we're hardly talking Enron or Madoff here.But some folks just Won't Let Theranos Go.  It comes up again and again and again as some kind of existential moral statement instead of the one-every-few-years business scandal that it actually is.

I don't think codon equivalence is preserved when you shift the read frame by 1 or 2. Moreover, a DNA molecule with changed codons is slightly different chemically at that place - which means a protein that might have previously attached there for some reason now might not.

In medieval and early modern Western sources, exonym Rascia was often used as a designation for Serbian lands in general, and consequently the term Rasciani became one of the most common designations for Serbs.(...)""h"	binarray2000	6.720694	2.88044	comment	4.0	20.0	1558274914	8.554734

Biology is a collection of evolved patches. It can have much higher complexity that it would seem to need.Yet human DNA is only about 4GB.  That's big, but not so big as to be beyond analysis.   Without computer assistance, getting a handle on it would be hopeless, but we're past that point and making steady progress.(How complicated is physics?  Things looked good in the era of Maxwell's equations, but it's become much messier since. In physics, much is out of reach of experiment due to being either too small (superstrings, if they exist) or too big (where's the missing mass and the antimatter?

It must be maddening for those involved not to be allowed to discuss it, or even having to actively lie about it while government officials leak freely in the game of thrones.	wjnc	6.555415	2.5412712	comment	4.0	60.0	1538760364	8.340605

Well, funny enough China banned cryptocurrency mining, and a lot of miners (allegedly) crossed the border into Kazakhstan, where energy is cheap in the form of oil and gas. The proportion of bitcoin mining out of Kazakhstan has massively increased since then.The miners drive up the demand for oil and gas, increasing price, leading to the protests.Now, how true is all of this? No idea. But you can bet that in the coming weeks the Kazakh authorities will blame cryptocurrency for the entire issue, redirecting the anger people are feeling.

The old OKCupid where people filled out quizzes and the software just gave them a compatibility score ( based on their answers ) worked exceedingly well.OKCupid got sold to the match group around this time, and they started aggressively removing features, such as search and messaging.

That will leave them with only state-controlled news.

Hilter, another 'moon-calf', with his 'first available dozen debt-encumbered lieutenants', did far more damage than Stalin ever did, and far more damage still than Bismark, who would be the 'big' Napoleon to Hitler's 'little'.The amount of horror a head of state can spawn has little or no relation to their individual talents or lack thereof.

I do remember pretty much no one smiling or expressing much of any emotion, and remember there being just... in my mind, enormous numbers of people.

It would be nice, for example, to have a clear motive for why Russia might have poisoned the man. According to the wiki article the Russian justice system had sentenced him to 13 years in a penal colony in 2006, and then handed him over in a prisoners exchange in 2010. What happened to upgrade that to a death sentence in 2018 that the GRU didn't know about in 2006-2010?Evidence should be a high bar. We might suspect the Russians, but lets not pretend there is any clear public evidence beyond government say-so. The government can be wrong, just like the rest of us.	roenxi	6.454451	2.65035	comment	4.0	28.0	1522268428	8.331096

This would mean you need more PE teachers in the morning, more math teachers in the mid-day. There's a reason schools have multiple periods of each course, and that those periods rotate day-to-day.One interesting follow-up study could be to compare night-owls/morning-larks in rotating schedule schools vs schools with fixed schedules. We could then see do night-owls do significantly worse in the classes they only take in the morning, vs night-owls who take classes rotating throughout diff periods of the day?

If you're essential, they're going to do whatever they can to keep you.  If you're replaceable, they probably don't care that much whether you in particular stay or go, but it will certainly cost money to replace you, which they'd rather avoid spending.Only a completely irrational company would cut someone loose just because an online profile with that person's name on it appeared somewhere.	pmiller2	7.333097	2.426714	comment	4.0	13.0	1590226608	-4.262101

Make profiles based on activities and swipe right or left on the activities you want to do.Revenue sources would include:- Ads for local businesses, classes, and events.- Annual subscription which is cheaper after the first year and gives you discount codes to events and restaurants.Once you get the site to work for date nights, let people be open to getting matched based on similar activity interests. Then you can solve the problem of two users finding a specific joint activity.Would this solve the problem of finding people to have sex with? No, but computers are bad at sex.Would this solve the problem married couples have of picking a place to eat? Hopefully.	afarrell	7.4175887	2.4184597	comment	4.0	24.0	1694710365	-4.2488384

Which means if you want to access that data in the DNA, you need to go through an intermediate, which, when it leaves the restricted area, is ok if it gets destroyed, because that original copy is still intact. That's where RNA comes in. RNA is designed to be mutable and temporary. I think of it like system memory. Reboot the system, and you lose it all. Want to protect it? Write it to the disk (DNA)., Similarly, you don't mess with files right on the disk - first you read them to memory.So, RNA i	COGlory	7.497206	3.4379563	comment	4.0	17.0	1606878641	5.7864165

Did DeepMind find a clever method to get around data-size issue or there is really a lot of known protein structures?

What ended up happening was oligarchs swooped in to take over from the central planners, and it’s not clear how the US could have helped steer it differently short of going to war with Russia’s upper class.	thehappypm	6.4355016	2.8569431	comment	4.0	26.0	1661894283	8.124878

In fact Russia didn't even have enough manpower to do it, so imported American and European labor, and contracted to American and European firms.The aim was to build up the means of production (capital, in western parlance) to western levels.However when Stalin died, and the revolutionaries of 1905 and 1917 died and faded away, the second generation of Khrushchev's and the like slowed down the infrastructure 	balance_factor	6.5726023	2.777049	comment	4.0	20.0	1511227316	7.8757296

In order to know which amino acid to use for each codon, it uses another kind of RNA, the transfer RNA (tRNA). Each tRNA contains an anticodon and a covalently linked amino acid.

This creates an imbalance where women are incredibly selective while men end up being incredibly non-selective (e.g. swipe right on everything). Clearly, this needs to be addressed -- this ""marketplace"" is a sham.Second of all, a lot of women (but also men) use dating apps to increase their social following (be it Snapchat or Instagram). This probably only pertains to people in their 20s or 30s, but it's a huge problem when trying to seriously find someone to date.Third -- the botpocalypse.

With men spamming all women with meaningless messages, there's little point for women to respond to men contacting them. But if a man received a message from a woman, it's more likely they're real and not a fake profile, and that they're actually interested.But dating sites that create fake profiles and use all these dark patterns to try to con you into joining should simply be avoided like the plague. Nothing good can come out of those, and there's no point in rewarding bad actors with your money.Articles exposing these bad dating sites serve a very important purpose here.	mcv	7.464615	2.3894827	comment	4.0	54.0	1569488817	-4.1092753

This problem is much more difficult to solve, and requires further homogenization (?) of the male and female gender role.This should be one of the more important challenges of our time. Lonelyness and sexual frustration have only negative impacts and are two accelerators for radicalization - which is a pressing concern in developed countries.	zapnuk	7.446335	2.4232757	comment	4.0	46.0	1569489829	-4.237809

Similarly, men and women both often lie about their age in order to help their profile sneak around age filters used by others.But the lying about height is pathetic and always backfires, often spectacularly, because the women can tell immediately when the guy shows up three or four inches shorter. So at that stage the problem is lying, not height, and it makes for a very awkward date if the date even continues.	sys32768	7.547302	2.6098058	comment	4.0	12.0	1663260182	-4.1834264

It's immensely important for the success of a nation and it's odd that the majority of how people meet now is through data apps and that there is no oversight over these at all. They have every incentive to match you with someone you are more likely to have a short term relationship than match you with someone that will result in a successful long term relationship. This has terrible long-term outcomes for a population at a large enough scale. With all of the talk of how algorithms can affect our society through news and social media, I've been somewhat surprised that dating app algorithms have not had much attention.	skrbjc	7.4393625	2.423332	comment	4.0	68.0	1707863394	-4.178531

Nothing worse than professional daters.- Look for undervalued assets! Sometimes modest or poorly shot pictures don’t jump out.- Pretend you’re speaking to a crowd with your profile.

I have people in my life that need a constant supply of internet, podcasts, music, tv, etc, or they start to get anxious.As an anxious person, I see why.

The blood samples would spill, which would gum up the mechanical workings of the machine and make a huge mess and contaminate all the other samples. The documentary claimed that Theranos started doing demos where they would pretend to put the blood samples into the machine, but really take it to a lab bench and run the tests there, and then report the results back.That implies to me that at least some of their tests were actually possible to do.

My understanding of both is that their error rates on individual base pairs are too high to reliably determine the actual sequence on their own (something like 15% error rates). Typically the long reads from these technologies are used as a ""scaffold"" to resolve the large-scale structure of a DNA sequence, while another sequencing technology, usually Illumina, is used to resolve the actual sequence. (Illumina produces short reads, but it produces a lot of them, and the error rate is much lower, about 1%-5%.)

In essence, the U.S. has built a (digital) mutually-assured destruction deterrent.

20606175	It's very hard to find a partner now	"It's very hard to find a partner nowadays. In the past, people dated within the local community, so women were limited to their local dating pool. With the advent of online dating, women can afford to be choosy and pick from guys all over the country, if not even all over the world. As a result, many men that would have found someone in the past are going to be lonely nowadays.Now, the obvious reply to that is ""but online dating is for men too, look at all these guys meeting a different girl every day"". This applies to a very small minority of men. The confident, attractive types with great bodies. An average woman will still get lots of attention on dating website and have a lot of guys to pick from, an average guy won't really get any attention on such websites."	skocznymroczny	7.506265	2.3753414	comment	4.0	22.0	1564922740	-4.1496863

But for pro sports or things like marathons with huge number of participants, you're getting the top of the curve. A pro-woman athlete could dominate most of us average peeps (male and female), but when going against career athletes, we're hitting the limits of how we happened to evolve.Human males are still larger on average than women when it comes to muscle mass, which is the driving factor for a lot of sports.

The entire strategic bombing doctrine of the Army Air Forces was designed around it, emphasizing daylight raids on ""pinpoint"" targets to best capitalize on the Norden's accuracy.The RAF advised against such a strategy, having tried the same type of raids themselves before American entry into the war; they found it impossible under combat conditions to achieve the degree of accuracy needed to knock such targets out.

The sanctions were relaxed by the Trump administration within the first month of coming into office while a stake in Rosneft has been sold to an anonymous buyer behind a cayman islands holding company.

It struck me as funny, and a bit sad, that an American who relied only on popular culture and mainstream media would think the answer to that question was easy: French! Of course!Having had the opportunity to travel, work, and even live outside the US, I realize now just how wrong that view is! The variety of dessert foods in France pales in comparison to, say, Italy or Austria. "	jballanc	6.823096	3.1759868	comment	4.0	20.0	1497642190	-11.974376

14592242	I wrote a blog post a few years ago 	I wrote a blog post a few years ago explaining how molecules get to the right place at the right time. The short answer is that cells are nothing like the nice, peaceful animations. Cells are extremely crowded and things move extremely fast. Glucose molecules, for instance, move around cells at 250 miles per hour and collides with something billions of times a second. An enzyme might collide with a reactant 500,000 times a second. And proteins can spin a million times per second. So as you suspect, by random chance molecules are in the right spot very frequently.http://www.righto.com/2011/07/cells-are-very-fast-and-crowde...	kens	7.5095983	3.525134	comment	4.0	24.0	1497933580	6.4599853

But I worry about SIDS to the point that I find that I sometimes startle awake and need to check the bassinet to make sure everything is okay. Hopefully, research like this can lead to a way to screen babies for risk and come up with some sort of treatment option.

I have no idea what can be done if there is a higher risk, I guess more intense monitoring comes to mind. I don't even know what actually causes death by SIDS, and how you would stop it.It's a truly horrible thing however, and I hope this can help stop/prevent it for future babies' and their parents' sake.

Whatever time the Russians were delayed eating your soup would be less than the time you were delayed in making it.The only way it would work would be to just put the pot over the fire and run.   Without someone watchin it, the window of time between soup getting hot and soup burning/boiling into nothing would be slim.  A more likely version might be that starving Russian troops were so hungry that, upon finding ingredients left out, they stopped to make soup themselves.	sandworm101	6.3579226	2.8762312	comment	4.0	13.0	1652986175	11.2754

Women getting way more _likes_ is plausible if men swipe right much more than women do. But each _match_ involves a man and a woman getting a match.	cehrlich	7.4185677	2.411011	comment	4.0	13.0	1655276476	-4.197772

The rhetoric on HN when markets are talked about, e.g. the labour market, often revolves around free markets being good -- because it favors this typical HN's user position. They have never experienced any precariousness.Now, comparing dating apps to a market is very slimey, but the analogy work to the extent where the focus is the HN user's expectation and how prevalent the market discourse seems to be here: like the worker offers their labour force to a company, a pretendent offers their social time and skills on a dating app. Except that the HN's user is experiencing the precariousn	hikingsimulator	7.4661107	2.3858922	comment	4.0	30.0	1655278130	-4.269572

It isn't ""emotional abuse""."	sanderjd	7.39182	3.3162212	comment	4.0	53.0	1672346770	10.799094

After the first few months, she would mostly sleep in a basinet the entire night. She transitioned to a crib easily, and now sleeps in a bed for about 12 hours per night without getting up.Our second on the other hand was a complete nightmare. Crying for almost the entire night for months on end. He eventually settled down a bit, but we finally caved and let him co-sleep. He slept with us for almost the entire first year, and is just now moving to a crib.So I don't even think it's genetic. It's almost purely random.	ryanSrich	7.269545	3.4723775	comment	4.0	12.0	1672353800	10.730574

Certainly one persons life can’t detract from large scale statistics. However, I have 6 children. They have all responded to methods of behavioral training in wildly different ways.My oldest two could not do sleep training. 10 months of trying for almost every night and they did not just adapt. My middle daughter embraced it after a single night. My adopted middle son didn’t need it at all and was naturally “good” at sleeping. My youngest daughter and son will fall asleep right away if around someone, but otherwise will stay up for hours (but never cried about it).Again, one family experience but each child has their own needs and responses.

He would not stop crying. We stayed up with him an absurd amount of hours trying every idea in the book to soothe him to sleep and nothing worked. He was probably getting 6 hours of sleep a day at a time when he was supposed to be sleeping 18. He lost a lot of weight and we were scared and exhausted.After a few weeks of that my wife finally put him into his bassinet and stepped away. She sat there next to his crib crying with him for 5 minutes, and then he fell asleep and slept for the longest he had in his life.

Instead of building a community where hanging out/studying with other students until lets say 8pm and then going to sleep would be the best for most students.

It didn't cross his mind you can also go to bed 3 hours later than everyone else.On a different startup podcast, there was a guy claiming he went to bed at 7pm and woke up at 3am! He claimed his kids went to bed at 7pm too. I mean sure, maybe between 1 and 3 years of age, but in the long run this is just absurd (or you are not putting in an equal share of parenting, or spending time with your kids or spouse in the evening.)	ryanjshaw	7.110044	3.4998698	comment	4.0	14.0	1676972828	10.751587

When you look at their situation from an objective point of view it's so obvious why they remain single and yet most are unable to see it. They either have no hobbies, hobbies that are almost exclusively shared by other men and often show no interest in their potential partners' hobbies. A lot of them also spend most of their time in online communities that are almost completely absent from women.

Unless you do a great job explaining the purpose of dating (courting?), There is a very high chance she'll simply become the temporary play thing of dozens of men. And being smart and well educated seems to have basically little to do with it.. I know many more married hair dressers than I do girls in tech. And beyond that... Many that ARE married are basically angry at life because they settled and are not sexually attracted to their husbands even.

Just because you have built up incredible emotional maturity, stability, and intellect doesn't mean someone wants to be with you.

Read the actual report from the DNI. Election counts weren't altered, the ads are nothing-burger. The hacks on mail systems were primarily done with spear-phishing, the same things businesses are caught with every day. 
My conclusion - phishing is the real story here of any consequence, if we want to ""do something"" it should be centered around better defense against this. That said, it's very interesting that Podesta's emails DID reveal collusion between the campaign and revolving-door political/media employees (CNN leaking debate questions to Hillary, etc). That's also a very significant story, and the more the narrative about Russia sucks all the oxygen out of the room, "	aksss	6.705084	2.405077	comment	5.0	16.0	1531773363	8.341803

However, as one who speaks BCMS and Albanian and travels the region for months each year talking with random people about these things, my own experience is that is merely a subculture, not anything representative.A lot of people going abroad in the 1990s, or as gastarbeiter before that, were coming from Bosnia, the Sanjak, or Kosovo and they understandably are loath to identify with a state they saw as dominated by the Serbs, who committed atrocities against them. For Albanian speakers, Yugoslavia was a Slav-dominated project in general. As for Croatia, significant opposition to Yugoslavia began already by the early 1970s and it only got worse after the 1991 war.	OfSanguineFire	6.675437	2.9229624	comment	5.0	92.0	1698387571	8.536566

You make it sound like a first-date hour (or so) is given freely and first-date evenings are rarer. Which sounds reasonable, but also seems contradicted by the part I quoted.

So if you endorse this, aren't you just opening the door for every election cycle whereby the US's enemies get to wade in and strategically release information that they've obtained through espionage? And don't you also therefore, start to create a dynamic in the election that candidates have to attempt to appease foreign adversaries in order to avoid damaging their election hopes?What if Hilary had come out in February of 2016 and said ""Hey, Putin's not so bad, he's got legitimate interests in Ukraine and I think we should leave Europe to stand "	SilverBirch	6.744089	2.3663354	comment	5.0	23.0	1669199237	8.608971

33929987	The Turkish lira is currently experi	The Turkish lira is currently experiencing ~85% year-on-year inflation.  Our domains' prices are denominated in US dollars, not Turkish lira.  This problem looks to be caused by currency headwinds.  At the time of initial registration, the amount of Turkish lira paid would have been worth a lot more than it is now.Also, 13040 TRY is worth US$700 at the current exchange rate, not US$850.  That's actually a slight discount on the correct exchange rate, as another available domain name in the same pricing tier (e.g. 6b.dev) is showing as costing US$720/yr.  So by paying in Turkish lira it looks like they're currently getting a discount of around US$20/yr, presumably because the prices displayed in Turkish are lagging the real exchange rate.

27963049	I am a structural biologist studying	I am a structural biologist studying Archaeal viruses and CRISPR/Cas proteins. From my point of view, AlphaFold has basically just gotten better at multiple sequence alignments. It's not a bad thing, but it's unfortunate useless to me because sequence divergence happens so quickly in the organisms I study that even the best results are still basically made up. It's nice that AlphaFold got better at generating sequence alignments, but it's not a magic bullet (a la folding figured out from first principles.)Interestingly enough, if I get experimental data of an archeal virus protein, it almost always uses a conserved fold. There's just no evidence at the amino acid level.	COGlory	7.1368313	3.5861135	comment	5.0	32.0	1627323382	-7.439636

The real cost is in the analysis and interpretation not the collection of the data. Thus, for your own benefit (i.e., clear knowledge of your genetic risks), they must monetize your data (i.e., find someone to pay them to perform the analysis, whether drug company or charity, e.g., American Heart Association). As long as they are up front about what they are doing and protecting your identity, your interests and theirs are fairly aligned.

Guys who get lesser matches get increasingly desperate, and start liking everyone.3. Being 'picky' for guys is hard work. It seems funny when I put it this way, but going through hundreds/thousand(s) of women, and even making a binary choice of yes/no is actually pretty tiring.

Social adventures are more fun than purely looking for love.My point is: have these low chances (0.1%) been taken into account? I have many stories where people won’t believe it’s true.

When the Russians (or Soviets) show gallows humor, or are simply bizarre or we (in the West) want to read dark undertones in what they wrote: hell yes, it's just like I thought, the Soviet Union must have been a constant nightmare!When they write in a self congratulatory tone, or simply praise their scientists: boring, let's skip that.It is a way to self-select a vision of what the Soviet era must have been: all depressing, all zany, all the time.The normal, they-were-humans-like-us bits get ignored because they are boring, confirming and reinforcing our preexisting ideas.	the_af	6.49548	2.6211104	comment	5.0	21.0	1637374621	7.8689857

14131414	 The extent of democracy in Turkey 1	" The extent of democracy in Turkey 1921-2017 is being rather idealized by a lot of these articles. It was for large periods a quasi-democracy with a strong role for the military (on a few occasions explicitly as military dictators, on many more occasions less explicitly). And beyond the military, also a strong role for paramilitaries.In this referendum, for example, the ultra-nationalist party MHP played a strong role, supporting Erdogan. Along with their notorious neo-fascist paramilitary units, the Grey Wolves, which attacked ""no"" demonstrations, especially any linked to Kurdish groups. But these militias aren't a new development. They're decades old, and have had various political roles over the years, usually linked to the ""democratic"" establishment.

Rather than producing skilled soldiers, he argues, it produced broken dysfunctional people.	dreen	7.372616	2.8872452	comment	5.0	26.0	1598450052	14.539565

In the 1930s, the Germans produced a huge amount of areal-studies scholarship with regard to the USSR (demographics, ethnography, history, linguistics, etc.). Even today scholars occasionally rely on those papers and monographs, as distasteful as a publication produced under the Nazi regime might be.No, the Germans’ delusion was that these many tens of millions of Soviet citizens were so unhappy with the regime, that they wouldn't rush to defend it.

The west was likewise ignorant of much of the details of life behind the Iron Curtain though that's a bit more understandable given the secretive nature of the Soviets.

Basically, give her a free pass for the first few months, if not longer. (The hormonal changes a few days in are no fun either)2) There is no point comforting a crying baby - they just don't understand what you're trying to do. Distract the fuck out of them instead. (This from a baby psychologist on a BBC documentary.)3) Babies are their own tutorial.

This works great for good looking women but not men who need to convey gravitas/worth in order to attract women. This is based on the theory that men are 'success' objects.

This causes the body to produce more testosterone in the testes rather than front loading the cycle. The primary impact is your testes continue to function, while testosterone over time will chemically castrate you.This has been in use for 60 or so years but isn’t an FDA approved use of clomid. The primary reason is clomid is cheap to produce and not patented.

If you are dealing with revenge bedtime procrastination (it's a term) or a non-24 hour circadian rhythm, the later you have to wake up, the later you will go to sleep.Many people are dealing with things like that. I would regularly see my co-workers online at 2 - 3 am when our core hours were 10 am - 5 pm. My company recently changed core hrs to 12 pm - 2 pm, and unsurprisingly, I see the same co-workers up at 5 am. I would expect to see people online throughout the night if we shifted core hours to 3 pm - 5 pm, even if that schedule perfectly accommodates typical working times.N = 4 or 5, but I don't think delaying school times will solve much.

Imo, it would be generous to say the effect was marginal at best.In hindsight the whole thing was pretty stupid; and lines with the Russian government’s increasingly erratic and incompetent behavior.

The pool of people is much smaller, but the app makes it so easy to create an interesting profile with some personality. Plus the fact that you don't simply swipe but are actually incentivized to take a closer look at the profile and respond directly to one of the snippets, which also serves as an instant icebreaker that launches you straight into a conversation. As a guy on Tinder I'd get a match maybe 1/20 swipes – and after being on there for a couple weeks it would go to 1/50 due to the app downgrading me for not being in the top 10% of popular prifiles.On Hinge I get a lot more women responding to my messages and also more requests directly from them.> If a guy can’t set up a decent profile or send a message beyond “Hey”, it d	somedude895	7.402585	2.412607	comment	5.0	18.0	1677491849	-4.356409

The aspect of a 'runtime' which I see carrying over is that once the 'source' is 'compiled' into proteins, something makes the interesting behavior of those proteins what it is. I think where the analogy could be misleading is that the architecture of programming language runtimes tends to be a single coherent system with definite separation from programs executing within; whereas in the case of proteins, a large part of what provides for their biologically interesting behavior is just their general chemical properties (which are sort of contained	westoncb	7.4119163	3.463836	comment	5.0	31.0	1516920404	-6.880187

* Many relationships now happen based on online dating. In a sense, a series of  algorithms are already dictating human reproduction.

Oil is priced in dollars, so if you considerably increase the value of the dollar, you'll sink the price of oil, which will hammer most foreign oil producers. The dollar index went from ~80 to ~160, from roughly 1980 to 1986, by far the greatest dollar move in modern history. Oil moved inversely to the dollar gains. The USSR economy was heavily dependent on the price of oil staying as high as it was in the 1970s (oil went from ~$20 to $100+, levels it had never remotely seen before). Having gotten used to the price of oil being so high throughout the 1970s, their already weak system was unable to absorb the outsiz	adventured	6.5981593	2.7902756	comment	5.0	15.0	1544922519	7.8127065

To general astonishment, he kept this promise, and with the regrettable exception of Lithuania this commitment to not repeating the crimes of his predecessors is Gorbachev's greatest legacy. In 1988 you would have been hard pressed to find anyone who could imagine the mostly peaceful collapse of the Eastern Bloc, but Gorbachev had the moral courage to accept this once unimaginable consequence of his policy and to see it through.	idlewords	6.424845	2.7730231	comment	5.0	149.0	1661894413	8.263246

Only straight men I know who don’t have these issues tend to be incredibly physically attractive to the point where they’d have women come up to ask them out on dates everyday.

So commonly parents get told that babies (should) sleep around 12h a day. What nobody talks about is the variance. There are babies who sleep only 8h a day and others who sleep close to 20h.

It all works out because the operations are atomic (heh) (don’t need to worry about two proteins trying to break down the same molecule at the same time) and the type safety (proteins are highly specific on what kind of chemicals they target) means you don’t need to worry about trying to perform some invalid operation.Turns out collision detection is real fast in real life!

These bits of RNA are in turn used as the blueprints for proteins, the molecular machines that do most of a cell’s work. If DNA is your phone’s home screen, then transcription is like tapping an icon. By sampling the RNA present in a group of cells, researchers can see which programs those cells are running at that moment; by sampling it after the cells have been infected with a virus, they can see how that virus substitutes its own software.

It's pretty terrible because I think most people don't actively have any way to meet single people their age, so people pretend apps are somehow a band aid for a deeply atomized society. Unless you're in a foreign country or a tourist, the advice I've heard repeated over and over is trying to meet others through organic social connections (ultimate frisbee, D&D, work, class) so that there exist some social fabric to base a relationship upon.(Pretty good, slightly cringey, video on how apps use the language of capitalism

I did put a lot of work into my profile - going on dozens of dates, learning from the bad matches how I could signal incompatibility earlier, and generally just going head first into the trial-by-fire of online dating for the first time.Things are progressing slowly for me but to be honest my caution is the limiting factor.

On the other hand, it seems that there was a period when Jogalia was perceived in a rather negative light by Lithuanians. Not sure if 'traitor' is the right description of that sentiment, but definitely getting into a personal union, that ultimately led to the formation of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, seems to be judged rather unfavourably.

No dating app can fix its users' mindsets.There are three rules on dating apps, and they haven't changed in the last couple of decades: be attractive, don't be unattractive, and inject humor.

These are people who are trying to break into upper middle class or beyond by pursuing high risk high reward economic opportunities and sacrificing much in exchange.

A divorce will be nasty, particularly with a borderline, but a lifetime spent with such a person will not be a happy one.With any kind of mental health, the person “suffering” from it has to be the one who wants treatment, and with BPD, most of the suffering ends up outsourced to others, which eliminates that motivation.I know this is hard to hear, but part of BPD is an inability to form healthy relationships. The flip side is that it takes two people to maintain an unhealthy relationship.

Adolescence is the age when women would first become pregnant, and the ancient's concept of marriage was probably not the same as ours. (There is evidence of monogamistic tendencies in humans for a long time but that isn't synonymous with marriage.)Teenagers are biologically wired to want lots of sex and they tend to do it at night.

It's still a bit away from really solving protein folding as it was marketed.For example, multi-complex proteins are not well predicted yet and these are really important in many biological processes and drug design:https://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-h...A disturbing thing is that the architecture is much less novel than I originally thought it would be, so this shows perhaps one of the major difficulties was having the resources to try different things on a massive set of multiple alignments. This is something an industrial lab like DeepMind excels at. Whereas universities tend to suck at anything that requires a directed effort of more than a handful of people.	nextos	7.1416698	3.5755556	comment	6.0	57.0	1626376334	-7.4390273

If you were lower 50%, you'd only see people in the lower 50%.

My phone is in my hand at all times, scrolly-anxiety-inducing apps become impossible to avoid.This describes me perfectly.

Normal KGB practice for this was to set up agents, but then let them run free with no control from Moscow or any requirement to send info back to Moscow. This made them virtually undetectable and when the Russian Federation disbanded the KGB, those deep cover agents continued to function.

But those strategies, while optimal for individuals, make the experience overall disappointing.I wonder if there is a way (in the game theory sense) to craft a strategy that is both optimal for individuals and the community, and then design an app around that.	subjectsigma	7.4562154	2.3751428	comment	6.0	35.0	1655271515	-4.204001

Why is there no Tinder/online dating equivalent for making new friends locally?Instead of dating-specific qualifiers, it'd ask for your interests, hobbies, values, age and other demos, then match you based on overlap.Not Meetup - it's not quite solving the same problem, and so it solves things differently (focusing on shared interests and on discrete meetup events).	dkulchenko	7.537045	2.338127	comment	6.0	20.0	1609206716	-3.8754482

I thought taking the hassle out of swiping could give my app an edge over Tinder.It was working fine for a week or so before Facebook caught up and revoked my API keys (effectively killing the app). They didn't give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they'll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.Moral of the story: never trust big tech.P.S. I open sourced the app a few years ago: https://bitbucket.org/stonepillarstudios/workspace/projects/...

There were two friends of mine who took the same 8:00 AM math class one semester, and they never met in lecture, except on quiz days.Even the early birds I knew didn't quite like the morning classes, because they then had to rush towards lecture halls first thing in the morning, rather than strolling leisurely to the library, eating breakfast, or jogging and taking a shower, which I suspect is what many early birds most enjoy about being an early bird.The problem is that there are seminars and stuff that occur at at like 7 or 8 pm, so university life almost necessarily extends late (after lecture, dinner, assignments, projects) in the evening at least on some days.

It seems unlikely that any APT would burn ALL of its 0-days for the iOS platform in one campaign, so they likely have more which they can pivot to. Of course there are  3 nation-states who are most likely to be behind this operation, but which one was it? If possible, we should be looking for other victims of this attack using the IOCs discovered at Kaspersky. If we find other instances of this attack on Taiwanese government officials or members of the Uighur population, for instance, that would be a smoking gun for attributing it to one particular nation.

Its fundamental abstraction is different (mostly one of massive interconnectedness). Engineering logic gates and the like, mostly, doesn’t actually allow you to build better genetic circuits.	koeng	7.5223947	3.4232492	comment	6.0	28.0	1704895506	5.682687

If this paper is correct, AF2 is actually able to recapitulate much of the detail that we previously believed required expensive dynamics simulations, which is about the best possible news because it suggests that we can omit these costly calculations.It's almost certain now that AF2 will win the Nobel Prize, as this represents some of the most ex	dekhn	7.167035	3.5865388	comment	6.0	35.0	1705622611	-7.44916

The idea was that any inconveniences would be temporary, and more than made up for when the transition is complete.The immediate result, however, was a significant drop in quality of life for the majority of the population, with a corresponding rise in crime.

What about factors like personality, physical appearance, marital status, age, gender or political opinions? Really dating apps should just randomly assign you someone to have sex with and refuse to give you more matches until you provide evidence you have done so. Given people might be unwilling to comply with these directives it probably needs to be enforced by the state, at gunpoint if necessary, for us to achieve the unbiased utopia that all right thinking people must want.	mattnewport	7.4340134	2.4147534	comment	7.0	31.0	1559229240	-4.203811

Because I expect them to be staffed by exactly (precisely) people like you and me and the people reading this forum, and I believe there is an incentive for the intelligentsia to completely ignore all political things and simply be awesome stewards of a safe world.  In fact, I think that there should be a secret conspiracy by every single intel worker worldwide to band together online in a meta-community.

While it's certainly true that you get more matches on Tinder if you're attractive, this overall narrative is vastly oversimplified, and the conclusions drawn from it are inaccurate.

One of the central concepts of anthropology (and I think, by extension, history) is that you don't judge other people disjoint from you in space and time with your cultural norms.History has been awful and brutal every year since we began writing it down, and well before that, too.

If you filter out the free users and only match guys who pay for boost with girls, it's a much better ratio for those guys and a better experience for the women since guys who buy boost are more invested and more likely to follow through.	welshwelsh	7.3832808	2.429895	comment	7.0	31.0	1665503465	-4.28205

If a user had this feature turned on, in theory it would allow hackers to scrape data on more than one user by breaking into a single user’s account.23andMe's blame is an obfuscation of the problems which underlie this situation.1.  There is the matter of having insufficient granularity in their sharing options within the DNA Relatives program. It comes with two general levels, which is not enough.2. 23andMe limits one to seeing the closest 1500 matches who have opted-in to DNA Relatives.

23295401	Perhaps there is slightly slightly d	Perhaps there is slightly slightly different ground energy state of the two different chiralities and Nature selected the slightly lower one. I have not seen evidence supporting this hypothesis.A similar mystery is why DNA chose a base64 nucleic coding system for 21 amino acids and a few punctuations. Some of the codons are redundant and some unused. (There appears to be a fossil base16 coding system inside it.) And synthetic biologists have modified it into a working base216 system with additional nucleic acids and amino acids. Perhaps again there is some ground energy argument as to why this universal 3-billion year old coding system is as complex as it is and no more complex.	peter303	7.5116096	3.4221618	comment	7.0	25.0	1590358944	6.281039

The easiest way to find that is to:1. Search for variants in that genome where the allele frequency is close to 0 in a very large population e.g. https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/2. Look into variant effects for those you prioritized in step 1 using https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.htmlRare diseases are typically due to a coding mutation that alters the protein coding sequence in some significant way.If you need help contact details are on my profile.

Infants have no control over their environment, and crying is almost their only way to communicate.I'm not enthusiastic about sleep training either - the gradual, controlled removal of sleep time emotional support by the parent. I would suggest to be very conservative and cautious if you want to take that route, and as the article states, definitely not before the age of 6 months.Edit: I saw another comment which talked about ""checking in"" on the infant during sleep training. I think there is some middle ground I would be comfortable with after 6 months of age, where you don't rock the child to sleep "	metabagel	7.343777	3.388332	comment	7.0	50.0	1672339616	10.802806

All apps rely on repeat business, yet here repeat business depends on failed relationships.It is theoretically possible to make 'repeat business' on long-term reputation attracting new customers, similar to how schools and universities can thrive despite only ever serving a customer once. However, how often will someone need to introduce others to a dating app? A multi-year timeline for word-of-mouth is probably too much for a VC funded app.There exists dating businesses that can profit from long-term relationships, its called Church (Marry at a church = lifetime donor + children likely become members too), hence churches are far more optimized and effective at building long term relationships than apps could possibly be	anonylizard	7.382408	2.4462342	comment	7.0	40.0	1690985032	-4.288709

When a relationship (or whatever goal) is made, people will payout their bounty. Or they can tip and the like for dates, good matches, etc.The biggest killer of dating apps is the disparity between mens extreme thirst and women's extreme reservation. Both need a reality check and I think others doing the matching would provide it.Edit: Also, augmenting this system with AI/LLMs/transformers would make it enormously powerful. It's basically an AI matching framework.	Workaccount2	7.4091916	2.4076707	comment	7.0	58.0	1690985573	-4.3016524

Non-coding DNA determines expression levels, genome confirmation (shape), and replication efficiency among other things.The term junk DNA misleads students into thinking that these sections of DNA play little part in how a cell functions. Quite the opposite, the “junk DNA” is responsible for orchestrating the “non-junk” bits.	axg11	7.5328298	3.4045184	comment	8.0	40.0	1648935577	-5.757871

That's called shadowban in the case of OP. Bumble started doing the same practices a year ago (which makes sense as they have the same founder)But they are not 100% wrong, Tinder is not here to make people meet each other. They are here to make money and people don't pay because they get more matches, they pay because they are frustrated. Tinder needs a way to keep girls active on the platform, and for that to works they have to prevent boys to have a negative behavior. That's why they shadowban guys easily, as soon as they detect non standard behavior they shadowban, people keep seeing profile and keep paying.

Not that this should be a surprise to anyone.Where I am considered attractive, I've gotten 80+ matches in one day and random women messaging me at 11PM telling me they're lonely and to come hang out. I've had more first dates that involved sex than first dates that didn't.Where I am not considered attractive, I get literally no matches except for the occasional Onlyfans spammer.

I wouldn't be shocked if a few years from now research came out showing that it has similar effects to adults, but they're just better at withstanding it than teens.This is purely anecdotal with my group of friends, but we all can safely say that we feel mentally so much better when we're not on those apps, and yet the pull is always there when you want to expand your dating reach beyond your immediate circle and you hope that maybe this time around you'll get lucky and find the right partner.

In one case I achieved strides in protein design by reducing the engineering cycle from months to days.  Imagine hitting ""compile"" and having to wait a 72 hours to know your result.  That's biology, even with a fast organism like yeast or e coli."	dnautics	7.4718075	3.4458187	comment	8.0	41.0	1525422675	-6.864538
17323874	This interview with John Carreyrou [	"This interview with John Carreyrou [1], the Wall Street Journal journalist who is largely responsible for exposing Theranos, goes into a lot of detail. It's long, so if you want a shorter answer, jump to the question ""What technology did Theranos actually develop?"":Basically there were three iterations of the technology. The first one used microfluidics, which are basically the repurposing of the micro-fabrication techniques that the computer chip industry pioneered to move tiny volumes of liquid. Theranos tried to work on that for several years before Holmes lost patience in late fall 2007 and abandoned it. At that point she pivoted to what was essentially a converted glue-dispensing robot.

It was frustrating as heck to keep getting led on by fake profiles.eHarmony is the worst: they actually sold my email address to spammers. How do I know this? I have my own domain, and use a unique (hard to guess) email address for each site I have to give an email address to. So it was trivial to nail eHarmony as the culprit.Someone has already linked to the OKCupid blog post which explained pretty well why you should not pay for a dating site. Then they were bought out by Match (how did the anti-trust people let Match accumulate so many sites?), and any principles they had went down the drain.Basically, the market is ripe for a respectful dating site. But OKCupid started this way; and in the end they sold out.  What makes you think y	1024core	7.436687	2.4004383	comment	8.0	67.0	1569471460	-4.208504

At one point, it was mechanical automata. Then it was hydraulics. Then it was electrical circuits. Now it is computers.It seems that some people have become overly attached to the computer code explanation of DNA, viewing it not just as a convenient analogy to current technology but as a fundamental truth. They will ask questions like “if DNA is code, then what corresponds to functions? or exceptions? or data structures?” and end up working backwards from the analogy instead of observing what DNA does and building a mental model from there.(It doesn’t help that the code analogy is very flattering to the programmer’s ego.)	kweingar	7.5388584	3.3926141	comment	8.0	47.0	1707291196	5.663396

While no one will every know ""what would have been"", it's arguable that these reforms made Turkey more ""European"" and less ""Middle Eastern"" - which I think was the intent.So, today Turkey is more like an Italy than a Syria (though that is changing), and perhaps those reforms are part of the reason why."	hereforphone	6.7824874	3.1070273	comment	8.0	67.0	1627399099	8.957993

It's Theranos's investors and Theranos's business partners that are mostly at fault. They didn't do their due diligence and simply assumed (hoped) that the technology worked. They were too concerned about missing out on the ""big one"", which clouded their judgement.No patients were harmed. The only losers in this are the investors that invested in Theranos. Given that they blindly trusted the pitch, without verifying that the technology worked, that makes them very bad and unskilled investors.Unskilled investors losing a lot of money is, in fact, a very good thing for the Silicon Valley ecosystem. It's how bad influencers are flushed out of the system."	fmstein	7.116611	2.980068	comment	9.0	38.0	1529361665	15.110215

The least that should be done is disallowing them from broadcasting as long as Russians are also unable to access services.Twitter labels all tweets as state sponsored already but they should do more.

When this is not a war where people are siding with the Russians. I just... it's so hard to see where that Venn diagram overlaps.Do the Russians have spies in the US government that can access this stuff? How have our security processes not caught that?Or did Russian spies pay someone with clearance to get these? Why did that person go along with it?

By the time I was 17, I was on steroids.I'm in my late 20's now, and I've got to be on TRT for life, due to how compromised my endogenous production of testosterone is (my Leydig's cells no longer function. They don't produce FSH/LSH, which in turn means I naturally produce the Test of an 80-year-old man).I got lucky in that my response to TRT puts my testosterone up around 1,100ng/dL which is around twice what the average person has. And during my steroid use, I have bloodwork where my testosterone was over 10,000ng/dL and e2 (estradiol) were over 200 pg/mL.You'd never know from talking to me, 	gavinray	7.461062	3.4219813	comment	9.0	47.0	1668350237	-4.4031253

13868036	I am an American living in Russia.  	"I am an American living in Russia.  When I was studying Russian I read a number of Chekhov's short stories and got a feel for who he was.I later came across one of his quotes: ""В человеке должно быть все прекрасно: и лицо, и одежда, и душа, и мысли"" (Everything in a person should be excellent: his face, his clothes, his soul and his ideas).  I sometimes discussed this phrase with Russians, eventually coming to be believe that ""face"" in this context meant that you should do all you can to appear clean and groomed, not necessarily that you need to be beautiful.  I liked this quote and it can be a starting point of interesting discussion when I talk to Russians about Chekhov.There's a funny story about when Chekhov went to Tomsk (now a town of about 500,000 people in Siberia.)

But in the variation of the game where there was punishment instead of reward, non-anxious people still performed as ""ideal learners"" whereas anxious people's predictions became totally out of whack. In other words, the overly anxious mind temporarily lost its capacity to correctly formulate heuristics, which can lead to all kinds of mental chaos.Personally, I remember that I was once in a job interview where I had to code on a whiteboard. I was so overwhelmed with anxiety that I was temporary incapable of completing simple coding tasks.

It may stem from an appeal to see engineered works from a system far different than our own both on the technology front as well as cultural engineering/propaganda front; there may be some appeal in the notion that the USSR is historically contained/bounded in some sense and can be isolated and studied; also, the political message of focusing national efforts on progress/technology in some sense would resonate with engineers (though communist policies impeded innovation and no doubt industrious politicians stood to gain more than industrious scientists/engineers at most junctures). Would be interested in others’ thoughts.	medymed	6.5231423	2.625034	comment	11.0	68.0	1591072708	7.628296

Compatibility is an illusion. Most people tend to date until they have an idea of ""what they don't want"". Once they know and they find someone who checks the boxes, they settle down.This article https://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/ is not about a guy who created some algorithm for finding love. The algorithm was simple. He went on enough dates to know what he didn't want, and then found the person that matched that criteria."	poorman	7.4799933	2.4084454	comment	11.0	74.0	1594233861	-4.206781

It's really hard to convey my feeling of alarm to people here though. Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it, I guess.Doesn't help that the conformists have been allowed to frame the narrative as 'either you agree with us, or you're literally Hitler/Stalin' depending on political alignment, which is a very powerful weapon to shut down discourse.This rising culture is freedom and diversity in all things except thought. This is how totalitarian regimes form.

(political brand certainly, but maybe overall as a country).As in, Russia is no longer a trustworthy seeming, interesting, attractive place to want to go visit or collaborate with or be associated with.I mean, of course it depends on the level of detail you're dealing with and who exactly you're associating with.  But for me, a general observer, Russia certainly seems to have gotten a history of doing and being the source of shady things.Even aside from that, and this is probably skewed by the history books focusing on the oddest parts of history -- Russia always reads like an odd, outlier place in history.

Apps like Tinder that normalized online ""dating"" (before the apps it was much less common among younger people) have allowed the ""apex predator"" men with good jobs/looks/personalities to have sex on demand with virtually unlimited numbers of women. This has also been made possible because a lot more women are now willing to be in non-exclusive sexual relationships at the beginning when they are first getting to know someone.The data from old OK-Cupid studies clearly show that most women are only immediately attracted to a very small subset of men. It is these men who are having all the sex. Seems like a powder keg over time as the excluded men become bitter and forced to postpone getting married and starting a family.

The settlements with Theranos and Holmes are subject to court approval.Someone help me out: Does this 	nathanaldensr	7.167207	2.9044347	comment	12.0	109.0	1521045196	15.110259

Instead, overnight, investors just came to their senses about what kind of value this type of business is worth.

The interposing sections are file metadata. The shearing mechanism is the filesystem reconstructing a stream from the lower layer blocks. There's probably some redundancy and error correction in there too.It needs a filesystem for the same reason they were invented for computers: to provide an impedance match between the upper layer semantics (a stream of pairs describing a protein) and the lower layer storage (blocks). Using block structured storage is more flexible in terms of being able to insert in the middle of a file, etc etc.	dboreham	7.5175734	3.4297616	comment	12.0	57.0	1680194099	5.8394656

Going by this article dna, researchers labeled it junk just because they couldn’t analyze it well and prioritized the easier 92% and thus didn’t understand it. Calling it junk just seems like trying to compensate for not understanding it like “I don’t understand it but that’s fine because it’s junk anyway”And the scientist quote seems so wrong. if missing almost 10% of something when that ~10% is not like the other 90% then it seems like a very bad assumption to assume that it doesn’t show a lot of important features.The quote: “ You would think that, with 92 percent of the genome completed long ago, another eight percent wouldn’t contribute much“	mint2	7.541079	3.4085248	comment	13.0	118.0	1648921075	-5.7378545

I once laughed at a report of a mercenary saying he was woken up several times a night with ABBA as a form of torture. I then internally cried thinking of the amount of times I woke up just to hear screams, and put them near my hear in the middle of the night. Or finally falling asleep only for screaming to start, and the rush to stop one child from waking the other, and leading to double screaming. On rough weeks I feel I get ptsd or fear of night time.I honestly do not understand why evolution gave us this harsh treatment.	ptsneves	7.2496777	3.4650874	comment	13.0	64.0	1677444719	10.804323

Everyone would message me straight away.  If I didn't reply most would message again in a few hours.  A few would get very angry/upset that I didn't reply.I think Tinder is a real stroke of genius.  All users, men and women, get given the same interface and the same choices.  But of course things are not really equal.  Men shotgun and women pick and choose. Tinder has essentially made Bumble, but they have plausible deniability. No need to enforce any rules about women messaging first when that emerges naturally.	laurieg	7.3916326	2.4152684	comment	13.0	244.0	1524791665	-4.2383647

Is it literally only the top 0.1% of men that are getting the majority of the matches?i.e. are women who are say 7-8/10 on the looks scale only matching with guys who are 9.5/10 on the looks scale, so guys who are 7-8/10 getting zero matches?	saberience	7.445738	2.3994665	comment	13.0	86.0	1606246325	-4.231544

I'm a pessimist about this AI innovation cycle's prospects in general AI and in particular drug discovery.Has protein folding been solved?  Yes.

If it works, and I sold them at cost, it would reduce the cost of oligo pool synthesis by ~100x and possibly gene synthesis by 10x.For about 8-9 years now my goal has been to build a cell from scratch for less than $1000 and enable anyone to be able to do so. While I’m handling the other bits elsewhere, DNA synthesis is a key technology primed for open source disruption.	koeng	7.528355	3.5170846	comment	13.0	96.0	1663336185	7.526824

We were also taught how great the US is, by contrast, that it doesn't do those things.Later, I thought I'd learned (maybe misheard?) that US could engage in propaganda or psyops, but that there were strict rules not to do it against US citizens.That seems like good guidance, and I'd welcome an honest review that checks whether we're living up to standards that have been an inspiring part of our national character in the past, and leads to any corrective action.Maybe US collective leadership realizes a way here that we can build upon our ancestors' great ideals, and follow through further, not drop the ball.	neilv	6.544519	2.6480348	comment	13.0	71.0	1663599880	8.034811

America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not """	ksec	6.4039745	2.9040372	comment	14.0	242.0	1645803045	8.312678

It's fine as a very rough and oversimplified analogy, but if you try to apply it to the details I think it hurts more than it helps.And important aspect of biology is that it is really much more analog than digital in many areas. Many interactions are not entirely on/off, and they are influenced by a lot of other factors in the environment of the cell. This is a part that really doesn't match well to how people understand coding. The digital aspects are also inherently coupled to their physical representations. That are not just four letters A, C, T, G in the DNA, each of them also has different chemical and physical properties.Some analogies to coding concepts work quite well, but you really have to be 	fabian2k	7.491723	3.3880036	comment	16.0	93.0	1640176366	-3.9172425

The lighting choice is very particular.Twitter was heavily used to seek help by people in turmoil, even hundreds of people were posting from under the rubbles.

I've pretty much given up on dating. I have a total inability to find anyone I'm interested in that is interested in me.When I was younger and I wanted to go to bars and get drunk and be an idiot I had plenty of attractive sexual partners.So I don't buy this at all. The guys I know who have an easy time dating are 1 or 2 points more attractive, make minimum wage as yoga teachers or selling crystals or dumb stuff like that, and tell Women painfully stupid stuff they want to hear about their quantum vibrations matching and other new age nonsense.So I can say this narrative empirically doesn't feel true for me.	awaythrow483	7.543866	2.3903089	comment	16.0	91.0	1644446495	-4.0345893

The parenting advice world is chock full of people who found something that worked for them and who then made the unwarranted conclusion that it is universal truth. For example, their techniques that ""always work"" definitely do not always work. Maybe they always worked for their particular babies, but I have been in situations with my kids where neither shushing and patting nor holding and walking worked to stop crying.My general feeling is that you can drive yourself nuts trying to figure out why your baby is crying, and, as the blog author mentioned in his conclusion, you may still be unable to figure it out.

There was very little top-down directives about how to develop the product during that time.OkCupid had excellent growth in the first half of the 2010s, but as that growth started to plateau, it was pretty clear that the focus moved to following Tinder's trends in an effort to match their level of growth.

These apps are search engines optimized to match women with the top 5% of men. These apps are designed for women. Being average or even above average will almost never result in a date. Tinder was designed like a slot machine which will ruin your self-esteem from constant rejection but your hope of a large reward will keep you going for ages. You will have a much higher success rate as an average guy simply with a completely cold approach. That is how bad online dating is for men.As an example, a slightly above average man who generates 16561 swipes on Tinder will generate 7666 likes and 8675 dislikes.

You have to enter your availability, pay 5 euro and if you don't show up on your date you get perma-banned for life.This works so much better than swipe-and-chat, because you become much more selective in who you like (keeping you from swiping endlessly) and because it's so focused on getting people to meet IRL I imagine it has a much better higher success rate than Tinder et al.

And while I doubt the SEC is going to go after every CEO that raised a Series A on a pitch deck that was pure fantasy, the people who participated in the round might bring them in if it served their purposes."

Shouldn't someone be working on a 50 year long study where people are brought in at age 20, genes sequenced and dna stored, and an extremely thorough battery of parameters (height, length of each long bone, eye color, etc.) is measured. Tie everything in with medical history. Do the same thing every 10 years for each subject until death.With a large enough sample pool, we'd be able to correlate features with obscure genes, wouldn't we? Am I missing something fundamental?It seems like now is the time to get started.	_archon_	7.5167184	3.4568698	comment	19.0	74.0	1469641327	-4.977947

I was getting a minor in Russian language, and it seemed like a fun trip. It actually got MORE fun because in the run-up to the trip (in spring, 91) there was some dissent in the USSR and many parents wouldn't let their kids go. In order to create a large enough trip, the University opened registration up to university-area retirees, so we ended up with a cohort of probably 30 folks. Half of us were under 25, and the other half over 65. It was the first time I'd ever really hung out with older people who weren't relatives, and that's really something we don't do enough of.

There is little to no hope of that in today's society, regardless of how damaging her actions are.Edit: I'd love to be proven wrong on this comment, but I don't have much faith that this will ever come to happen. It is laughable to think that the American justice system is actually neutral across races or socioeconomic lines. Also, I agree that Theranos is toast. I just think it will try to become toast somewhat quietly.	micaksica	7.19837	2.906203	comment	21.0	139.0	1480037157	15.129944

No, to do that they want you to pay for a ""Boost"" which lasts for a mere hour, and costs $11.99. You can buy 5 and get a measly discount where they only cost $9.99 apiece. If you are already someone who does not get frequent matches, this is a terrible deal and the duration is insultingly low.Never mind the practice of ""Roses"" in which the only way to message some women is to buy a like that costs $3.33 each.

I don't understand why anything but month-to-month would make sense for dating, specifically.I mean, if you are a dating app, you should be striving to get users to delete your app as fast as possible (for the right reason), not hang onto an annual subscription.	dheera	7.402653	2.4157677	comment	22.0	115.0	1619448696	-4.3139057

We can't make efforts on every single parts of our life.But if you do this for entertainment, and dating, and food, and the rest, your life is filled with bland yogurt.Netflix is no substitution for a hobby. Ready-made meals are no substitution from cooking vegetables. Chats are no substitution for IRL human interactions.It's crazy we even have to say it, it should be obvious.I guess it shows how much humans are biased toward quick rewards.

Yet the worldwide conspiracy to wake up absurdly early for any important matter is really annoying /s. As I’m approaching my 40s and am lucky enough to have a flexible schedule, waking up early is still borderline painful for me, and if I don’t wake up late enough, my day is usually not as productive as I would want it to be, if not outright ruined.

I'd say it's about 80% male. So most of them fill with fake accounts to get the balance backs.The matching algorithms don't really exist, they are extremely primitive and usually optimised for engagement. All services show you a whole load of super attractive people on the first use (either fake or just popular profiles), only at the second day of use you get to the real profiles.Due to the imbalance and fake accounts, as a male you rarely get response on messages. Most men just give up after a while and start to spam generic pickup lines to just about every profile. Woman g	LeonM	7.449976	2.3956194	comment	23.0	194.0	1569487311	-4.1584425

Moreover, in cases like this one, already-published material is being destroyed, in a way that wasn't practical in the USSR, due to technological limitations (though they did try — famously Beria was airbrushed out of official photographs).

Additionally, none of them are really designed to get people off the app, but rather they're built to increase engagement and keep people on the app.One idea I've had is to disallow conversation in the app, and instead focus on making date plans if there's a match. Another idea is to introduce a payment aspect to make spamming economically unviable, except that the payment goes to the recipient instead of the platform. Some apps have tried things like this, but they kind of suck because it's not real money so it's	brenden2	7.4196014	2.4099395	comment	25.0	133.0	1574695772	-4.276005

Basketball, Football, etc.For those sports to thrive, teams need to practice, in order for practice to be efficient, it needs to be at least an hour. So 2 hours are allocated (suit up, practice, suit down). In order for children to be able to commit to 2 hours extra of their time BEFORE their parents get home (5pm), class would have to end by 3pm. Now, pair that with the fact that most school districts don't have enough bus drivers for every school, they pair up. A single bus driver will start their day bussing high school, then will bus elementary school (which starts later in the day). So high school ends a little earlier so the bus drivers can bus the elementary school kids home after they bus the high school kids.

This is not meant to be a buck up or shut up comment, it's just that you can't improve your life until you change your outlook on things.  You won't be able to move forward on things until you confront your feelings and accept your position to move out of it.To answer your question, yes.  My 30's were a mess with a divorce, a parent with dementia, a kid who had a unknown behavior problems they said was autism, and trying to keep my dad's business running all while maintaining a full time job. You can get better, but you need help doing it and have to actively accept you aren't all alone.	kemiller2002	7.474359	3.5037098	comment	26.0	260.0	1671460854	-4.4851832

We don’t live in a hunter gatherer society anymore, we just don’t. There’s lots of wisdom in that way of life, and sure we could learn from it — but there’s enough anxiety as it is, parents don’t need more of it.We have three kids and we sleep trained them. (Not a pediatrician, standard disclaimer.) This article calls it an ‘extreme’ practice. For us, ‘extreme’ was the sleep deprivation we experienced with baby number one as we tried every ‘no cry’ method in the book. The baby cried and cried and cried. Once we started sleep training, there was a bit of crying and then - a sleeping baby! Through the night! Total amount of crying went from hours to zero.

21629144	I had an idea for a dating app a whi	I had an idea for a dating app a while back, in which the basic idea is that you pay the service to message someone (above a free weekly limit of say 1 msg).The pricing would be reactive - as popular attractive people get more messages, the more it would cost to message them, growing exponentially in order to limit incoming messages to approx a few a day. Unpopular people who got few messages would have a price that would go down to zero. This would hopefully solve the problem of women getting hundreds of messages a day, and men getting neither any incoming messages nor any replies to their outgoing messages.It shouldn't be much of a problem to get women on board, as they rarely send messages anyway and it would always be free just to put up a profile and receive messages.

The classical example of a lemon market was the used car market - most people who bought ""lemons"" (unreliable cars) would exploit information asymmetry and sell them on the used market, and over time the reputation of the used car market deteriorated to the point where it was affecting the value of new cars. The car manufacturers solved the problem by introducing gatekeepers - certified used car programs, that certified that the cars weren't lemons.So who are the ""lemons"" on dating markets, which bring down the reputation of dating markets for the rest of the players?

But they mostly skim across the issue and go to conclusions like ""this gene or set of genes are responsible for that outcome"".But coming from a CS background that sounds a bit like non-sense. I feel like it is like saying that ""this processor instruction is responsible for that outcome"".
