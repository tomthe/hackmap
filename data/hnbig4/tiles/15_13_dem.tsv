A large part of that ""it just works"" is the fact that it's all based directly on my phone.* That restaurant we just decided to go to. Already in navigation. AND! the maps are all current with road closures/traffic issues.* The music that I was playing, it just keeps going* The garage door opener/lock/etc that I just added to HomeKit - automatically pops us."

However, one thing computer industry people don't seem to get is how much the idea of Apple owning the ""dials"" on the instrument cluster as shown in the keynote this year will likely go down like a cup of cold sick at most European auto makers. In many cases the designs or colors used in the dial faces have decades of brand history behind them.Regardless of what customers desire, auto-makers are in no rush to become just a dumb pipe for apple or google's driving software. So far not one automaker has of yet publicly announced support or plans to support the more extensive CarPlay Apple demoed. I think if it does ship, it will need to support far, far more customization on interface and dial-faces than was shown in the keynote "	giobox	11.146228	7.381062	comment	6.0	28.0	1664316703	-6.461842
