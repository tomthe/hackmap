To ad-block, but then to replace it with a suitable privacy protecting alternative to the point that Brave (and everyone else) has no idea which ads you were served and what your browsing history is.  The entire point is to mot just be an ad blocker, but to be private, and to provide a workable alternative to the ads that track us on websites.Furthermore... brave lists on their website what they collect in analytics programs.  And... it's not much.  They also send the answers in what they call 'low resolution', which basically means multiple choice with ranges making it a lot harder to identify you compared to a specific number.

The people who care about privacy should be more worried about getting caught in Google's web of properties than about privacy per-se - that company is bad news. And Firefox is more closely aligned with Google's interest than Brave is. Look at how much money Google has been funnelling to Firefox over the years.Having a different engine is really more of an inconvenience than a strength - it means that sometimes pages will not work in Firefox.

It seems to me that you are confusing TikTok with Douyin (the Chinese version.)The thing is, TikTok's audience self-censors.

They will use Edge, or Safari, or (in case you think you can make backroom deals with Microsoft and Apple to implement this in their browsers too), they'll use Brave.

Brave has presets for 1&2. Additionally, Brave adds on top more opt-in ads using BAT as an incentive.Hence, use a normal browser with ad blocking, not chromium based, and FLOC is a non issue.

This shift is not surprising given TikTok’s phenomenal popularity, but it’s also shortsighted: platforms like Facebook could be doomed if they fail to maintain the social graphs upon which they built their kingdoms.This. I on occasion visit Facebook to keep up with what friends are doing. If they turn it into TikTok, I will have zero reason to go there any more.	thematrixturtle	5.42464	-3.609051	comment	3.0	31.0	1659073014	14.740942

TikTok's emphasis is not on distraction, but on video. TikTok is successful because it understands the power of video without the legacy mental model of television: longer videos punctuated by attention-breaking ads. YouTube is still firmly operating in this legacy model.	keiferski	5.4139814	-3.6200035	comment	3.0	11.0	1659087095	14.743137

No other platform has been able to circulate viral videos as quickly as tiktok has proven to be able to, and the for you page, rather than encouraging people to actually follow individual accounts, means that people are actually seeing the videos that keep them on the app the longest (and in turn off other apps), rather than having to curate their own feeds.	zjaffee	5.4213943	-3.61753	comment	3.0	10.0	1659114807	14.737429

Now if you want to donate to a site that hasn't registered your browser will try for a period of time, and if the publisher doesn't sign up the tokens are returned to you to distribute elsewhere.	justsee	6.0119543	-3.6048343	comment	3.0	27.0	1556150128	5.8923283

It isn’t exactly an app that asks for a lot of real world identity data to signup with.IMO their biggest thing would be their ability to use computer vision to instantly process videos and match faces with real world identity databases and then to link faces and backgrounds to locations, family members/connections, interests, etc.	tempsy	5.3917465	-3.6331384	comment	3.0	17.0	1607441704	14.747211

Choosing to migrate their default search to Google was a money grab by Firefox and that money is, in turn, 100% dependent upon tracking. I think this is why what limited privacy options Firefox does offer are entirely opt-in, and often hidden behind menus that your average user will probably never visit.By contrast Brave has had things such as blocking of fingerprinting for months (years?), and also natively supports OPT-OUT ad blocking, script blocking, third party cookie blocking (which FireFox does also but once again in a less direct fashion), single click native TOR access + ID swapping anywhere, and more. And I think the biggest difference is that this is all directly exposed to the user. If a user clicks the big iconic Lion icon i	rjf72	6.0276403	-3.6125686	comment	3.0	13.0	1559281014	5.965602

They have some more work to do to really make it competitive with the mighty Chrome.So after all that time, Brave is the first browser registering my interest due to these regular news stories.

36906774	There are two issues with this:- Par	There are two issues with this:- Part of the protection Tor provides is due to having the single browser made specifically for Tor. Nearly everyone uses it; this gives you a sufficiently large crowd to blend into. There are fingerprintable clusters inside this crowd, but at least they are still large enough. By using any other browser, you make yourself stand out and even diminish the anonymity of the whole network a tiny bit. This can become a problem if enough people are using custom browsers. Brave in particular is also not restricted enough by default (no JS etc). Default settings for everyone matter.- Brave's Tor feature wasn't thoroughly tested in real situations. AFAIK they had issues with it, and also warned users not to rely on it as it's not complete.	orbital-decay	6.025664	-3.6115563	comment	3.0	10.0	1690552299	6.018006

The content was so different than Instagram.I really thought it was invaluable (TikTok is banned now). For us city dwelling upper middle class people, it gave a rare glimpse into the lives of people less privileged. And it wasn't maudlin or patronizing as a lot of narratives about the poor tend to be. Rather it was fun and authentic.I remember when the lockdown happened and a lot of migrant workers were left stranded, the news channels were filled with horror stories and heartbreaking videos of poor families walking hundreds of kilometres to their homes. But on TikTok, there were plenty of videos shot by the same migrant workers where they shared their woes, but would sometimes break into a dance or make fun of thei	puranjay	5.4055896	-3.625235	comment	3.0	13.0	1594739397	14.738062

Mobile users see a direct reduction in both battery and data plan consumption. Brave also protects users with privacy and security features such as HTTPS Everywhere to encrypt data traffic, fingerprinting shields, phishing protection, malware filtering, and script blocking.Maybe this is a good enough argument to get people to install it. But I seriously doubt you will get people to voluntarily pay money, which is slowly paid out as they surf the web, when the alternative is a free browsing experience with a standard ad blocker.Also, all of their listed benefits to users is accessible on all other major browsers now with existing extensions.	seibelj	6.0274134	-3.610972	comment	4.0	61.0	1470067894	5.924827

About half of the videos were mildly amusing but trivial, and maybe half I could barely watch because they were so excessively cutsey or repetitive that I could not tolerate them.So I forgot about it and did not open the app after that.  But then every few days or whatever I would get a notification and it was TikTok.  What I remember was that it was mainly random teenage girls saying or doing something trivial and mildly entertaining or just stupid but while they were doing it they were subtly showing off their legs or bodies in some way.Since I'm not a teenager and half of the video	ilaksh	5.4010096	-3.626954	comment	4.0	13.0	1552342937	14.756439

However their response to that second error seems sane to me.  If they're going to reactivate accounts closed for being too young, shouldn't they make an attempt to verify the age of the person reopening the account?  I doubt the FTC would be amused if TikTok started permitting 12 year olds to reopen their accounts with no form of attempted verification.Also I'm not quite sure I buy the argument that the birth date dialog was bugged.   Defaulting it to the current date is dumb, but was it really non-functional for some users?  Really?

(note 1, rubber band flick) ""wait till you see...""

This is an ad network.Even the block-and-replace-ads model has been tried before. Everything from iframes to browser toolbars.

There's lot of people with not a great deal of technical knowledge who are aware of Tor and might see it as a means to bulletproof privacy, unaware that using it through Brave on an OS like Windows 10 could easily expose them.Brave does present some kind of warning to users when opening an incognito tab. It just doesn't make the risks clear enough and will mostly be ignored.I'm not sure what solutions there are for this. Perhaps shipping Tor as part of a regular browser isn't a good idea. In fact, I'd say Tor should've never been tunnelling generic protocols and instead had its own protocol for sharing information. That's another conversation though.	c7DJTLrn	6.0237064	-3.6097624	comment	4.0	30.0	1613758088	6.0858583

I've really given it multiple tries, hours at a time, but it consistently fails to serve me anything that even remotely entertains me.My biggest gripe with it is that half of the content appears to be of the ""build some tension up by hinting at a certain conclusion of the video, then simply ending the video before it comes to that conclusion and leave the viewer clueless"" type, and TikToks famed algorithm seems to be entirely unable to discern that I hate this crap. Maybe it's because I watched some of these fully in the beginning until I understood the pattern.

FB primarily pushes content posted by your friends, while TikTok pushes anything that might interest you. They can subtly influence you. If they hate Trump, the can push joke videos about tax returns and his sexual assault allegations or something. In other words, try creating an unconscious association between Trump and evil in your brain.Another issue is that, if TikTok becomes crucial for advertisers, we give China power over these companies. Hiring people who have publicly expressed anti-chinese opinions or donating to the wrong politicians might suddenly ban you from the platform.	miki123211	5.3989406	-3.6271417	comment	4.0	12.0	1601283823	14.748034

The “free” democratic west where communication is limited by a handful of large corporate interests and a murderous government that pressures them to censor content they don’t like.TikTok may be owned by a Chinese company but there is no doubt in my mind they are being pressured by US authorities to control what is disseminated on their platform.

You scroll until a thumbnail or video title catches your eye, you watch that video, might like or comment, then click one of ~10 recommendations. The algorithm gets a positive signal based on what you click and your watch-time, but the negative signal on anything you don't click is incredibly weak.

This valuation doesn't reflect its current value per user - it's baking in an implied doubling or trebling of its user base in some short time span.I'm not saying that the assumption that Tiktok will meet its projections (and justify this valuation) is warranted, but I am saying that comparing Tiktok's $/user to Facebook, a mature/somewhat stagnant social network, is the wrong way to look at this.	propter_hoc	5.435513	-3.6005287	comment	4.0	13.0	1596806507	14.728937

As far as I'm aware, TikTok is pretty much malware, meant to collect every single possible piece of information it can get access to on your phone, so I would recommend everybody to avoid it, and I'm not opposed to a ban at all.What matters is the way it's banned. And why. And the current process feels every bit as wrong as TikTok itself.What the US needs is proper data protection laws. And then it should enforce those laws equally against US and foreign companies. Just arbitrarily banning one thing because you realise that what you always allowed for US companies, is suddenly a problem when it's a Chinese company, is absolutely wrong.	mcv	5.3907757	-3.6341586	comment	4.0	14.0	1597158960	14.747801

The currency itself is mostly useless and unstable, plus you will be making peanuts compared to even the lowest CPM country in AdSense.What we need is an ad provider that provides a meaningful experience to advertisers and non-invasive ads to publishers.

I think they made the right call by focusing on crypto, their search indexing technique is very unique (and it works!), as is their BAT attention token. They are _trying_ to doing something different, Firefox is not.What I instead get from Firefox for trying to support their monetization, is seductive-looking spammy ads on their New Tab page that come back even after I dismiss them. Brave ads vs Firefox ads would be a tough comparison - the former is more annoying and intrusive, but I definitely think I prefer them. And long term, I think I would bet on Brave _over_ Firefox, unless something changes.	nullspace	6.0158057	-3.6073046	comment	4.0	22.0	1635862563	5.968071

(Because they can get the same form factor without downloading a new app.)From what I've heard, the Stories copying strategy did successfully contain (but did not roll back) the Snapchat threat to Insta.

Otherwise it just looks like they're capitalizing on our content and keep the long tail of donations indefinitely, while also making it less likely that we get contributions from Brave users on other payment platforms, since as far as they know, they are already supporting us through Brave.	dessant	6.0086694	-3.6055882	comment	5.0	25.0	1545424834	5.9099874

It has yet to be brought to my attention what behaviors/patterns Tik Tok employs which set them apart from their US-based competitors, and I am in awe of how META/Alphabet have some nicely created this wedge based on their nationality to use as a cudgel against one of their biggest competitors. It smells to me a little bit like the LIV/PGA thing, where the Saudi Arabia connection was heavily publicized for the upstart tour as a reason to fight against the potential rival to the PGA.

Since it's built on Chromium, it has all the common extensions I use with Chrome (Dark Reader, uBlock Origin, etc.). It has built-in Tor and a rich set of default privacy features. The ads it provides are opt-in and the way that it allows the user to choose which website/content creators to reward allows a level of freedom to users that other browsers typically don't.I don't know about the ethics behind everything Brave is doing - but this built in functionality of 404 redirects with the help of the IA/Wayback Machine is, to me, an interesting and welcome feature.

This would cause integrity checks on the client to fail. Not to mention, the code to do this would have to land in our public repos on GitHub, where we would quickly be tarred and feathered.If you're capable of running the Tor browser, we encourage you to do so. Brave isn't as good as the Tor browser if you're smart enough to use the later.

The machine-learning bits study your browsing habits in a private, non-leaky manner.Once a day, your device downloads an aggregate catalog of many ad options to be studied locally. If/when an ad is found that fits your interests (as inferred by your browsing habits), the ad is displayed as an OS notification and 70% of the ad revenue is deposited into your in-situ wallet.So on the topic of targeting, Brave is able to deliver a better experience for Advertisers and Users, without the need to leak user information across the Web. The on-device ML bits learn about their user over time, delivering a better experience with maturity.I hope that helps!	jonathansampson	6.018468	-3.6065886	comment	7.0	53.0	1567094199	5.8770795

And I don't particularly trust any of the other third party browsers out there.I just want the speed and quality of Chrome but no obnoxious ads while I surf. Brave gives me exactly that.

They claim performance is better, but at the end of the day, it's chromium, I'm skeptical that they can do much to make a huge difference. Now they're offering yet another search tool. ok.

The video plays are high intent. If you launch TikTok, you are 100% going to watch videos. This is not true for Reddit or Twitter, making it harder for them to preemptively buffer content or over-optimize their architecture just for video playback.3.

(There was a ~month where I was getting incredibly depressing sideshows, so I don't think tiktok is 100% wholesome).My theory has been that people have been conditioned out of posting to Instagram (if you don't have a literally perfect life, then why post) and as a result Instagram just has less content to draw upon"	nemothekid	5.43855	-3.597784	comment	8.0	59.0	1662093712	14.735011

Here’s the tinfoil hat theory: Tik Tok is what social media was meant to be, but unlike American social media giants that made their deal with the devil and drive growth via separating and polarizing people, Tik Tok makes people feel like the world isn’t a scary awful place with “them vs us” mentality, and so it poses a threat to our political culture which feeds off division.All I know is that when I go on Facebook I just see angry boomers being quasi political	voisin	5.405728	-3.6238172	comment	8.0	40.0	1657474786	14.742424

US government does not want any possibility of US citizens' data being in the hands of China and their questions to Chew made that clear. The narrative of child safety, for example the story about the kid who commit suicide because of their ""for you"" page, is being used as a kind of legal ""pretext"" so they can ban TikTok."	throwaway4837	5.398354	-3.6283965	comment	8.0	148.0	1680121431	14.744772

The solution to that problem isn't to ban TikTok, it's to create a regulatory framework where companies are obligated to follow certain rules.That's the thing: TikTok is basically state-sponsored, Apple/Google approved spyware. I don't have a link handy, but I remember reading that security researchers found the tiktok android binary had the capability to receive code remotely and execute it, meaning that the CCP can make millions of Android phones do whatever they want, especially if the code uploaded includes exploits.But how do you legislate against that sort of thing?

The Reels are all short thumbnails of young girls of questionable age wearing little clothing in provocative poses/dances!

You can make Instagram's algorithm exactly like Tiktok and it still won't be like Tiktok because the users and content creators on Tiktok aren't on Instagram, they're not going to join instagram and the content creators you already have will leave.Given this feedback cycle I find it quite interesting that Facebook don't have a team of engineers just constantly building and launching new social media sites.

On the other hand, once you do click on that link (if and only if you don't have the app installed), you get redirected to the static link to the video and finally obtain it.This is an anti-pattern that enables further tracking and potentially unknowingly exposes user data when links are shared publicly.

Instagram is some strange hybrid mix of social and interest graph, and now it’s also a jumble of formats, with a Stories feed relegated to a top bar in the app while the more stagnant and less active original feed continues to run vertically as the default. Messaging is pushed to a separate pane and also served by a separate app. Longer form videos bounce you to Instagram TV, which is just an app for videos that exceed some time limit, I guess? And soon, perhaps commerce will be jammed in somehow? Meanwhile, they have a Discover tab, or whatever it is called, which seems like it could be the default tab if they wanted to take a more interest-based approach like TikTok.

33528142	After hearing so much about TikTok's	"After hearing so much about TikTok's addictiveness, I decided to give it a whirl. I spent a good few hours trying to get a feed that was interesting to me by searching for various keywords. I was mostly looking for weird, abstract, absurdist videos, but also anything else that interested me. Unfortunately it was quite difficult to find anything I actually liked. Most of ""weird tiktok"" seemed to be a teenager's idea of ""weird""―too fauxdark, edgy, memelordic. I did manage to find a few videos and creators I actually liked, but not enough to make my feed much better. I eventually gave up and deleted the app.Just one small anecdotal data point to counter the idea that the app is addicting for everyone. If anybody has any tips about how to get a better feed, I'm willing to give it another go."	nagonago	5.4079213	-3.6245809	comment	13.0	60.0	1667975641	14.736861

If you self-harm, you can find other people discussing and opening up about it. If you're in a toxic household, there's basically a whole support network for you. It's an exceptionally human way to interact with people online, and it's so much fun.IMHO, TikTok has been the most wholesome social network I've ever used and participated in.

Now, the Chinese are biting the hand that feeds it, by becoming an ally of Russia. By actively looking to undermine the West.

The point is that they could use this to spy at any point in time if they wanted to even if they aren’t at this very second.

I didn't like leaving behind a unique browser engine, which needs to remain a significant player.I don't understand a lot of the hate for Brave.  If you don't like the crypto integration, the ads, etc you can just disable them.  I feel the original intent, to be able to contribute directly back to page authors, was a noble one.  It may not have played out as intended, but it wasn't a scam.One year in, I've had no issues I can think of.  And now they have their own search engine, another net plus to the ecosystem.

It is the only enjoyable, enriching social media service I've ever used. Most everything many of us liked about the old/weird internet is present on Tiktok right now: almost no ads or commercial presense, personal content from real people (not hyper produced productions from influencers and pros), weird content, niche content, organically viral content, positive/encouraging comment sections. I've been exposed to such a huge diversity of things on Tiktok: people with physical disabilities, hilarious and creative videos from high schoolers, an elementary school kids frog journal, dance videos with single-digit views, large engine repair tips, home improvement tips, pet ducks, absurdist memes.

This number keeps growing, year over year. Something has to be done.Users who come to Brave are already blocking ads. They understand the risk involved in letting third-party software collect information about them, their person, their browsing habits, and more. Further, the risk of drive-by downloads is on the rise (or the growing popularity of crypto-jacking).Brave blocks ads and trackers for safety and privacy reasons.

If you're booked with the hotel, all kinds of adjustments are at least possible. If you're booked with Booking, Travelocity, Expedia, etc., it's somewhere between hard and hopeless.)Brave gets it right. Bing, Google and even DuckDuckGo do not.

I have never seen such a beautifully crafted user experience, from the recommendation algorithm that is top-notch the content that is catchy and highlights trends without overdoing it and the absence of political content if you don't engage with it (or maybe there is none at all).I don't have it on my phone, but I truly see it as the pinnacle of the stupidly addictive social media app and it scares me because it means that Chinese companies are just as capable as us to spin the next Facebook and distribute propaganda to the next generation.	belval	5.4043007	-3.626699	comment	21.0	131.0	1624026938	14.747652

That would be a better solution, IMHO. Let users download and use whatever app they want but keep a firm privacy policy. But, of course, geopolitics will take over, so I have ZERO hope for a tight privacy policy for all apps.Similarly, there is no such thing as a backdoor in apps for good guys (3 letter agencies) vs bad guys.

34602930	Purely algorithmic feeds work for Ti	Purely algorithmic feeds work for TikTok because people want to shut their brains off when they use the app.  It's like a drink after work.  Copy-pasting that logic to longform text misses the differences in the mediums, and how people interact with them.When I'm reading, I'm trying to be thoughtful, not titillated. And part of being thoughtful is consciously choosing what to read.One might say that sites like reddit and hacker news are just archaic versions of the same recommendation engine, but the friction is actually an important feature, and keeps the experience from devolving into lowest common denominator clickbait.	vagabund	5.4090633	-3.6240964	comment	27.0	141.0	1675202697	14.739211

You're still having all the analytics captured, it just goes to somebody with far less scrutiny than Google.	yabones	6.026239	-3.6094518	comment	27.0	142.0	1604350351	6.0535183

Outside of privacy concerns, doesn't the blackbox algorithm make anyone worry? We're building automated echochambers for an entire population. We're giving a Chinese company the ability to control the content consumption, and therefore beliefs and knowledge, of entire countries.
