I'm all in favor of higher costs for doing shit like this, but the humans making the decisions bear moral responsibility for them. When they bury critical safety issues, they should be held accountable whether or not this particular financial calculus went their way.Are there serious ""people who claim all safety-related issues should get a recall""? That's not the only other available position. Not every safety incident needs to lead to a recall, but that doesn't prevent good-faith judgements on whether or not one is necessary. The fact that we assume this won't happen demonstrates how catastrophically awry we've allowed the artificial construct of a corporation to run."	hypersoar	6.1812716	5.4944367	comment	3.0	13.0	1616342996	-9.094365

To me, recall means much more than just having to have the company replace something. It means they have to do it at their expense. So in this case, it's not as bad for Tesla's bottom line if it is just an OTA update. A recall is something that the car industry is used to doing whenever they have to fix a mistake. I would not be surprised if the industry doesn't have ways of writing those expenses off in taxes or something, so need to be able to specifically itemize the recall work.	dylan604	6.170635	5.5030146	comment	3.0	11.0	1676580293	3.983097

Here if you've only used 0.5 of 8Gb, and Tesla is required to make a recall, all Tesla is doing is replacing your old unit with the exact same model but now 8Gb free space instead of 7.5Gb free.Instead, if a new design is not developed, shouldn't it be treated like a recurring maintenance? like when the memory is 6 or 7Gb full, the user gets a warning to take it to the repair to have the unit replaced, or something.Also why isn't the memory emptied from time to time? old data should be of no use and should be backed up to Tesla 	yudlejoza	6.171263	5.5025187	comment	4.0	21.0	1610601996	3.9774835

That isn't my intention here.  I am providing context to this issue.
