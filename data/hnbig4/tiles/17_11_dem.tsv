First of all, the process was expedited at the request of the authorities, so it's natural that they try to reduce their risks. Also, even if we disregard the expedited process, the release (the rate of production and administering it) is faster than you'd expect normally, which in itself imposes a greater financial/business risk by exposing more people quicker to the same amount of risk.To say it in a less abstract way: given the normal/expected risk levels (say it's 1:100000), they'd get say a 100 complaints a year for a new vaccine that gets administered to 10 million people.

Then you start recruiting and for a vaccine, you’d want a large population (reflects usage).  So assume 6 months to recruit 1000 people.  They don’t all start at the same time, so if you’re tracking for 6 months, it will probably take 9 monthsfor the last person to finish the trial.Then you need to analyze all the data you collected, so another 3 months.

Most epidemiologists it the US, at least, believed that corona- and similar viruses were transmitted by larger droplets generated by coughing or sneezing. These droplets would not remain airborne long, resulting in the advice for social distancing and surface cleaning. The ""flip-flop"" occurred very shortly after it was demonstrated that they were transmitted by aerosol particles.3.

In the cancer context if you could differentially target the mRNA delivery to cancerous tissue, the 'payload' could be more generally cytotoxic but only affect tissue proximate to cancer cells.This seems like it's on the order of CRISPR for potential to change the landscape of medicine in the next 50 years.	jcims	13.637051	5.8627033	comment	3.0	26.0	1619963527	5.431622

It's very reasonable to prioritize healthcare workers who are far more exposed than anybody else and the lack of formal, peer reviewed studies is a welcome opportunity to subdue a panic buying bidding war.If truth was the only concern, I think that comparing the rough numbers between ""masked countries"" and ""unmasked countries"" should be more than enough to recommend masks. It's a planet-wide experiment and the control group is clearly seeing worse results.

When the mRNA is injected your body uses it to generate those spikes - that's just a normal function of your body. Your immune system learns how to attack those spikes, and so it'll recognize covid in general. mRNA is very short-lived so it breaks down, the end result being that your body gets some covid proteins for a little while and your immune system cleans them up.I think a really simplistic breakdown like this goes a long way to helping people feel comfortab	staticassertion	13.60549	5.8227606	comment	3.0	11.0	1628165440	5.482575

It may mean a 50% reduction in infection -- or it may mean a basically zero percent reduction. It depends on the exposure.Say that in a particular covid-filled room you have a 50% chance of being infected after 5 minutes and a 99.9% chance of being infected after an hour. Under a simple model, if you wear a mask that blocks half the particles, your chance of getting coronavirus in 5 minutes would be reduced to 25%, but your chance of getting it after an hour would be 97%.

Each step of that process involves peer-reviewed publications, public data releases, and reviews by panels of scientific experts.

If you are asking more strictly about sentiment toward the currently available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, I think that by and large we think they're a marvel of engineering, but have an array of assessments and opinions regarding pandemic-timeline vaccination, what it's meant to accomplish, and whether genuine public health decisions in such a context can ever be made independently of profit motivations of vaccine makers.

Sorry you’re in that position, I’m sure it’s stressful.After listening to Dr. Robert Malone, I’m beginning to wonder if there aren’t a non-trivial number of physicians against vaccinating kids, who are getting censored. He is adamantly against it. Problem is we can’t even have conversations about it in social media without folks getting censored.	40four	13.522009	5.6599193	comment	3.0	20.0	1641844327	5.298725
29881553	The main reason to wear a mask is to	The main reason to wear a mask is to prevent yourself from infecting others if/when you get infected again. One usually becomes infectious before the symptoms become obvious, i.e. before becoming aware of the new infection. Wearing a mask is mainly for the benefit of others, not for your own. And it’s a game of numbers. The larger the proportion of the population who wears a mask, the more the spread of the virus is contained. It is a bit like democracy: One's own vote doesn’t make a significant difference, but the collective votes do.	layer8	13.741891	5.1576467	comment	3.0	13.0	1641845847	-11.5292845

The most expensive part of a good N95 is, surprisingly, the straps — good straps that expand all the way around the head without snagging your hair are expensive, so you can be reasonably sure that any N95 that uses them is not counterfeit, as the material properties can’t be faked cheaply. The expense of straps is why 3M makes some N95 models in pairs that differ only in whether they have hair-snagging straps, e.g. 8210 vs 8210+.If you really want to be sure, go with Moldex. Moldex N95 masks are made (in the USA) with a unique process where the N95 filter is covered in a hard plastic mesh.

The humans become immune to whatever your sequence was (and maybe to Chimp Adenoviruses?).I'm sure there are reasons this might be better in some cases, and it involved less bleeding edge technology which made it a safer bet in a pandemic, but the mRNA approach seems obviously more general and even perhaps more re-usable.	tialaramex	13.581341	5.7868376	comment	3.0	10.0	1643655458	5.4217424

Most school boards won't even have outdoor recess on days like that.I have 11 nieces and nephews in 5 different school boards in Ontario, and not one of them has these restrictions. They eat indoors, they can take their masks off at lunch, and during gym class. Their teachers regularly post videos for students to watch, with their masks off, so that they can have that level of interaction with their students.We still do play dates with kids too. And birthday parties, where we can opt to go maskless if everyone is tested and comfortable with it.	purephase	13.617658	5.192844	comment	3.0	12.0	1644867206	-11.544837

I think you’ve had fragments of the truth presented in a way to try to make you believe things that aren’t true. Vaccines aren’t a platform that can be triggered to do different things. It does use RNA which is cool because it allows for more rapid changes. The vaccine will mostly work with a wide variety of RNA payloads with the only difference being the exact antibodies it encourages. In a few decades that might mean we could start developing and deploying vaccines in weeks. But rna doesn’t last long.

I have a reasonable choice about whether to meet someone in person, but not whether to use electricity. And while both may be harmful, only one of them can be the proximate cause of the continued spread of disease and even death.The strawman you're building is that we put health ""before anything else"". Being absolutist and making any one thing a priority to an extreme degree can of course be problematic.

Indoor anything is “unsafe”, as aerosolized transmission has been proven. Anything under a properly worn N95 doesn’t stop aerosols, and if anything will promote aerosols.The idea that wearing a mask from the time you walk in the door to the time you sit down is somehow affecting outcomes is insane. People should know that walking into a restaurant carries some risk of infection and a mask isn’t going to change that.1. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-5008	zaroth	13.62538	5.177781	comment	3.0	17.0	1607109612	-11.510778

Administering it without trials could have led to a nightmare scenario for a few individuals and anti-vaccine stance for a larger chunk of population.Ben is probably right, the status quo should change, but I am not sure if the 'opportunity cost' calculus he makes is accurate in this case.	raghavtoshniwal	13.55442	5.7478538	comment	3.0	10.0	1609865694	5.3792605

The individual is incurring some level of risk by not vaccinating.2. Society is incurring some level of risk if the individual's risk of getting the disease is increased (although shouldn't this not affect people who are vaccinated anyway?)Cons:1. You are mandating a person subject themselves to a medical procedure, a very personal violation of that person's liberty.2. Taking a forced vaccine incurs its own (low) risk.

In a vaccinated population the risks to the individual having a vaccine are low, but non zero. The risk of not having the vaccine may well be lower. The problem is that by not being clear that having a vaccination is an altruistic act with marginal risk but a massive social good the way is left open for claims of duplicity. This may be the key issue; some people won't agree with the desired position because the fact we are using isn't a fact at all.

Although no evidence has been published that SARS–CoV–2 can infect thymocytes or bone marrow lymphoid cells, our in vitro V(D)J reporter assay shows that the spike protein intensely impeded V(D)J recombination. Consistent with our results, clinical observations also show that the risk of severe illness or death with COVID–19 increases with age, especially older adults who are at the highest risk [22].

A large size RCT enrolls X0,000 participants. For example, the Pfizer covid mRNA vaccine clinical trial had 21,728 placebo participants. For every RCT participant, the RCT results are going to inform the course of action for hundreds of thousands of people. This is to say that such RCTs are extremely valuable given the high infectiousness of the virus.* The risk to the participants is at worst a moderate increase in the chance of being infected with covid. The covid fatality risk to a healthy adult is small. In the US there have been about 50,000 deaths with covid in <50yo age group.

Also, I've read that the Spanish flu ended with a fourth variant that was much milder than previous variants.Assuming natural immunity is better than vaccine, and this variant is very mild, this is probably the one you want to get. What if boosters are being pushed at the worst possible time? With boosters you're less likely to get Covid, and what we've seen is that vaccines have a relatively short period in which they are effective. If you skip this variant, couldn't you get affected by a much less mild variant once the resistance wears off?What am I missing here?That being said, you should probably listen to your local authorities / doctors which are currently advocating everyone get a booster.	bko	13.708218	5.612202	comment	3.0	18.0	1638930930	-15.034361

It mixes comments regarding the larger trial of Pfizer with this isolated company trial. At times it's hard to tell if they're referencing Pfizer or Ventavia (as ""company"").

The current population, however, is longer immunologically naive, and I think that researchers are underestimating the existing seroprevalence.At the same time if there's still pockets of entirely unexposed/unvaccinated people out there in rural areas or something, Omicron will likely find them since it seems to largely ignore unboosted Nabs to	lamontcg	13.720263	5.572887	comment	3.0	11.0	1640384862	-15.040001

Section 5.1 of the PDF seems to imply that the ""Initial Europe Doses"" are to be manufactured within Europe [0] ""following EU marketing authorization"".Section 5.4 which you quote from specifies that ""this section only shall include the United Kingdom"". As written, this section does not relate to the distribution of the initial doses in Section 5.1, but instead is about where AstraZeneca _could_ choose to manufacture the vaccine. That is why it explains the process by which they might get prior written notice for non-EU manufacturing sites, and discusses how they could be contracted with if they are unable to deliver doses.I think that gives them some leeway to ask AstraZeneca to increase capacity in "	lhnz	13.609314	5.816466	comment	3.0	18.0	1611959947	5.46245

Then various governments said it’ll be a year.No one was attempting to gaslight; this was the culmination of millions of professionals doing their best to make sense of the situation, and occasionally, uncertain terms being communicated incorrectly.

The first of those functions, it's ability to locate particular and arbitrary sequences, is its comparative advantage against all other technologies we know of. The second, cutting DNA, well, works I guess, but will likely be engineered to be more useful, or turned off in order to make way for other more useful functions.The protein is special for two different reasons: 1) it is able to locate DNA sequences with very high precision 2) and the sequence it locates can be swapped out as easily as changing the sequence of the RNA it grabs ahold of (trivial to do, can be done in a day, and can cost >$1 per target sequence to swap).

Laws requiring ""wear a mask"" are therefore simply virtue signalling, not actually useful.If you are at risk -- you would be protected only by wearing a personal powered HEPA filtration unit, and eye goggles.If you're not at risk, you don't protect other at-risk people by wearing most masks.  If the mask you're wearing would allow you to smell someones smoke -- you're not being protected; small vapor particles carrying active viral loads are similar in size to smoke particles.The whole thing is so astonishingly stupid, it's breathtaking."	pjkundert	13.742102	5.1463842	comment	3.0	15.0	1597259318	-11.536839

Can somebody please clear this up?As far as I understand, the mRNA just stays in the cytoplasm of the cell and gets used up by the ribosome to create spike proteins. The adenovirus vector used in the J&J (and other vaccines) injects DNA in the cell's nucleus, which seems at odds with the widely circulated ""it doesn't change your DNA"" statement.Do people make this claim because the cell displaying spike proteins is basically always eliminated by CD8 killer T cells?Btw here's a nice high-level summary by the NYT about how all the vaccines work: https://www.nytimes"	laplacesdemon48	13.591128	5.794137	comment	4.0	37.0	1618319707	5.439704

Meanwhile, the 10000s of patients from the big Phase 3 trials have been vaccinated for 6-9 months, so the usual scale of long-term side effects has long been registered.That's not to say that it's completely out of the question that there will be long-long-term side effects.

That makes sense, if the virus only spreads from sick people, the advice for everyone to wear a mask is not good health policy especially if there is a shortage.

They need to have a specific property, they need to be electrically charged in a certain way, and pretty much all lipids with that property are extremely toxic.The equivalent lipids in the virus don't have this problem because they come from the human cell membrane and they use the spike protein to fuse. Since the vaccine doesn't have a spike protein, it needs that special charge property to be able to spill it's mRNA.The question now is, if it took sooo long to find those lipids, just what the safety margin on t	jfkgktjjj	13.599445	5.8105006	comment	4.0	12.0	1623366324	5.4186034

I already had a box of N99 masks that I bought for the wildfires, so I wore one out anyway and got dirty looks. A short while later, everyone in the Bay Area was wearing them, and I no longer got those looks.

The FDA policies for EUA indicate they're only to be used when there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative. This makes a lot of sense - if (let's say) someone comes up with a new flu vaccine (an mRNA one, to continue this example, as that would be kinda exciting), you really want it to go through the full approval process instead of EUA, even if it is better.

The question from the government's point of view has to be whether you could have had the vaccine cheaper. After all, large sums of money have already been invested by the states for research and development. The question is what the contracts and conditions were for these investments. But if the manufacturers had hardly any costs and risks during development and are now allowed to hold the rights to the patents and make large profits with the vaccines, then in my opinion something has gone wrong.

For instance what if it turns out that something approved today turns out to be carcinogenic twenty years from now? This is one reason I feel mandating vaccines or coercing people using other means (like creating great inconveniences) is not okay.It also does seem like the approval process may be influenced by political pressure to remove barriers to hesitancy or to support vaccine mandates.

We have partly seen a misinterpretation of the Israeli data [1] and specifically the single low effectiveness value that appears to be the result of Simpson's Paradox [2]. Dr. Fauci reported this single value decline from the high nineties to the high seventies on Andy Slavitt's podcast [3]. Pfizer's CEO has promoted this same data, Israel's 3rd dose campaign is well under way, and Fauci's public statements are a strong indicator that the U.S. will follow the same path. British Columbia's Dr. Bonnie Henry indicated yesterday [4] that the Canadian numbers do not yet support a general 3rd dose booster but, like the UK, a longer 2nd dose interval due to a First Doses First (FDF) strategy may be a factor.The 	sradman	13.524567	5.7595634	comment	4.0	27.0	1631617237	5.393206

Those masks are almost entirely designed to keep stuff in, not to keep them out of your nose/mouth/eyes.The slightly reduced incidence of infection from direct contact would not at all affect the greatly increased incidence from much more frequent direct contact.

On the opposite end it is a reminder not to touch your face (prevents transmission from your hands) but won't stop you from breathing in an aerosol.Likely still a net win, but kinda a hard thing to do good research on.There is no doubt that masks that are designed to block things the size of viruses help.

I'd never go kayaking, or rock climbing.   I wouldn't swim in lakes, and you'd never catch me in the ocean.  If I were preparing for the worst, I'd go everywhere with a tourniquet in my back pocket, keep a few thousand dollars cash in my shoe, and get myself vaccinated for rabies right now.  I have no intent to do any of these things, because such fretting every possibility is no way to live.	RobertMiller	13.5990305	5.245338	comment	4.0	24.0	1646957303	-11.540303

However, with both variants, mRNA boosters led to strong protection against Covid-19–related hospitalization and death.

Moderna created a beta variant vaccine last year that is the furthest along in any trial IIRC.  Pfizer has an alpha variant specific booster with quite good results from trials too.The problem as I understand it is that it isn't profitable for either company to take a risk on producing these boosters at scale.  They have to take a bet that the variant they target for the booster will be the one to dominate in the next months, and right now with variants like omicron mutating and growing at astounding rates it is quite risky.  If they target the wrong variant that's a whole lot of completely wasted vaccine doses and they have to start over again.

At most, modifying genetic material could be.Secondly, genetic modification — whether by CRISPR or other methods — is an extremely generic process. Sure, it could be dangerous, if you use it to perform dangerous experiments. Can it have unintended side-effects? Sure, we already know about those. In fact, one of the great things about CRISPR is that it drastically decreases side-effects.But is CRISPR dangerous specifically because we underestimate the complexity of DNA?

In turns out that 0.3 μm is the hardest particle size to filter--they call it the most penetrating particle size--hence filter testing is done at this worst-case size. The reason is that filters work due to several mechanisms which dominate at different particle sizes according to a curve:""For very small particles, less than 0.1 μm in diameter, the primary filtration mechanism is diffusion and the filter is very efficient. For particles between approximately 0.1 and 0.4 μm the filter is less efficient as the particles are too large for a great diffusion effect and too s"	alister	13.599573	5.228816	comment	4.0	21.0	1589652982	-11.497062

Aggressive means contact tracing every single case. This is only possible with using all the gold standard tools to reduce virus spread: massive testing, travel restrictions, universal masking, and sanitizing. South Korea has demonstrated that this works fairly well even in a democracy even with few social distancing policies. They only recently closed bars.The biggest dividing line here seems to be masks. Countries whose leaders initially told them not to wear masks are struggling to achieve universal masking compliance. Most seem to have given up on being aggressive and are now having these debates of complacency.	gregwebs	13.641316	5.143933	comment	4.0	30.0	1589735973	-11.50429

Cold chains are tricky to maintain, let alone at -70 C. Having doses packed in numbers larger than one makes it challenging to vaccinate people at the centers, the unfreezing takes some time, and the vaccine cannot be stored eternally once unfrozen. So you have to closely schedule appointments with the treatment of the vaccine itself for batches of people. Which cannot be allowed to wait in line because of COVID-19.

The ‘it works on an isolated island with 5 million people’ fantasy.Except it doesn’t work on continents with billions of people with multiple governments.And then the magical mask fairytale. If only people had worn masks this would all be over. Except now it turns out people have to wear three masks on top of each other. How could that be if masks had solved all the problems? The answer is clear: they don’t.There is no point in blameshifting to people that ‘didn’t wear the masks and didn’t lock down’.Also it is 100% clear that tons of people can’t wait to be allowed to visit each other. Claiming ‘people aren’t going to congregate’ is simply a lie. In the Netherlands we had one test event with 1500 tickets and over 100000 people applied for a ticket. They can’t wait to congregate.	tinus_hn	13.736798	5.144394	comment	4.0	19.0	1614013276	-11.527585

What is unacceptable in America may be considered more normal elsewhere.In this specific situation there’s a pretty obvious power imbalance where the public do not wear masks and the authorities would be able to track them down and oppress them later (or just do what they currently do and grab them from the streets at the time). The threat of unmasking is one of the few things the people have to use against the authorities: when a policeman has his mask removed he will typically run away for fear of being identified. (The only other things they have are sheer numbers and the moral superiority of being basically peaceful against a violent government).A similar argument about law enforcement safety was used by Apple to remove	dan-robertson	13.732872	5.135205	comment	4.0	42.0	1602329584	-11.528063

Without a mask, I coughed while probing the space around my face with one of my hands, at a distance of maybe 9-12 inches away.I could easily feel significant airflow from the cough in a cone in front of mouth. Nothing to the sides (for purposes of this discussion, ""side"" means significantly off-axis from from the line down the middle of the cone, so includes above and below the face, not just left and right).2. Same test, with mask. I either did not detect any airflow or just detected a bare hint of some at the same test distance as unmasked.

The harasser was the one proudly filming their heroic act.(Addendum: there’s the obvious question, why not just wear a mask 100% of the time? There are no downsides, right? — There can be. Perhaps my mask had been in use for a while, I suspect it’s gotten dirty enough to be a potential health hazard, but I don’t have another mask to replace it? I’d still use it if people are around, but would try to reduce my exposure to it otherwise. Maybe I have asthma or some type of breathing difficulty, and wearing a mask makes it worse? I think those two are probably among the most common reasons.)	strogonoff	13.753014	5.138385	comment	4.0	27.0	1606162573	-11.504759

Basically, you can whip up a personalized vaccine which wakes the immune system up to the fact that it has a growing tumor on its hands.So far, the success rate is very far from 100 per cent, but the therapy sometimes works even in patients with severe late stage metastatized cancer and, in all likelihood, we will learn how to use it better in coming years.This progress could save way more lives down the line than just those at risk with Covid.https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8	inglor_cz	13.554613	5.759917	comment	4.0	60.0	1606747076	5.240486

It was also looking at vaccine formulations before the latest booster, so in a free person's normal life the protective effect is higher.Further complicating things, the more vaccines and boosters you get, the more protection.

Even so, it probably makes more sense to encourage people to purchase more reliable masks.	cmiles74	13.745262	5.157172	comment	4.0	28.0	1593814345	-11.525038

With (cloth) facemask, i have shortness of breath after running up a staircase, and after 15 min of regular walk i start hyperventilating.While i wear facemasks and consider it a reasonable measure, the government mandate was sometimes excessive. For example, at the start of the pandemic, the government mandated wearing facemasks everywhere outside of home, even in nature far from other people. I stopped to do recreational walks in nature, as it was just too burdensome to do that with facemask.

The WHO and CDC both issued guidance that public use of personal protective equipment was a bad idea, for fundamental scarcity reasons.  And in both cases the messaging was done poorly in a few spots and could have been interpreted as statement that masks don't work against covid.  They were heavily criticized for this at the time, and the criticism was carried by the media.  No expert ever told people that masks don't work, or that the public shouldn't wear them.  They were telling people to save them for the health care workers!And getting to the point upthread: that bit of misinformation is, again, something being deliberately propagated by people with a political agenda.	newacct583	13.7027025	5.1723137	comment	4.0	15.0	1593819315	-11.53195

28841602	Surgical masks (and other cloth mask	Surgical masks (and other cloth masks) make a small but significant difference in transmission. At the beginning of the pandemic, we didn't understand whether that difference was lost in the increased need to interact with one's face while wearing a mask (and we now know that SARS-CoV-2 becomes inactivated quite quickly on surfaces, like our hands).N95s and higher rated masks/filters have always been very good for virtually eliminating transmission, but are also much harder to fit properly. Most Nurses/Doctors need to have them fit tested, which is not viable for the general population. Elastomeric half-mask respirators offer the protection of N95s (or better!) but are much easier to fit safely, and I'm actually not sure why more people don't use these or why these weren't recommended.In m	beebmam	13.7296505	5.154369	comment	4.0	15.0	1634055794	-11.541013

And honestly if you are worried about the mRNA vaccines doing bad things to you... I have news for you, SARS-CoV-2 injects a lot more mRNA into your cells, and lots more of those 'spike proteins' you're worried about are created, in a self-replicating pattern, until possibly you die.  So you probably want to avoid SARS-CoV-2 a lot more than the mRNA vaccines.	ryanobjc	13.532434	5.718605	comment	4.0	15.0	1637568284	5.3578944

Just a while ago in Tahti, a family asked a nurse not to vaccinate their new born child.  The nurse did it anyway, and the infant died within 3 minutes.  A second family, minutes after, told the nurse also not to do it.  The nurse did it anyway, and the second infant died.  Apparently there were riots and the government had to come in a seize the vaccines (MMR).I'm not antivax, I'm actually pro-vax but with caution. I am trying to sign up to take an experimental vaccine under trial II because I think it would help benefit society and I understand the risks.

The solution seems to be online learning, but it’s worth noting that a major group pushing for masks in school (teachers) are the same pushing online teaching.

I realized this when I was working retail earlier this year and recognized that I could no longer smile at small children while masked.

Therefore, we have a very good understanding of their adverse effects in the first 6-12 months. What we cannot know, however, are possible adverse effects that are longer term. Susceptibility to other diseases maybe due to a weakened immune system. Possibly a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases.If these vaccines were regular, inactivated virus vaccines, we could extrapolate long term effects from other similar vaccines.

It's ironic that (I'm sure) someone out there will stock up on 10,000 masks and it will cause them to be in even greater danger because the sick people around them will have fewer masks.The CDC recommends that sick people wear masks to keep droplets in, and that people who directly interact with sick people wear masks while interacting with the sick person (to stop projectile droplets I presume).

Air that you inhale comes through the mask filter. It's not necesarily the case that inhaling and exhaling have symmetric effects. When you exhale, you increase air pressure inside the mask, which pushes it away from your face and opens the seals around the edge. When you inhale, I expect it would seal tighter. You can exhale while wearing a swimming mask and bubbles go everywhere. That doesn't mean the mask isn't otherwise water tight.2. Aerosol particles from infected people coughing and sneezing get caught by the mask and don't go into your airways.3. You don't touch your face with your hands.	munificent	13.721035	5.1606717	comment	5.0	31.0	1582824167	-11.521503

When this happens, it doesn't work as well because particles can still travel into the airway via open space gaps.I personally have not seen this implemented, but one possible solution I believe may work is to apply a thin layer of sticky hydrogen tape right along the edges of the mask so it would act like an adhesive that helps seal the open space gaps as it can fit with the unique shape and contour of each person's face.Medical hydrogen tape is the same material that we often see being used in those sticky pads that they put on a person's body during an electrocardiogram (EKG) test.

This was a reasonable conclusion at the time. To communicate that to the public, the party line was: masks no good. Many national organisations took their cue from the WHO.Now the risk/reward tradeoff has shifted: better research shows that masks, even ersatz ones, are good and the supply lines for professionals have improved.

The title might be a bit cryptic; the authors propose a convincing hypothesis that explains why Astrazeneca and JNJ vaccines cause rare but fatal blood clotting incidents.TLDR: mRNA vaccines turn their payload into proteins in the cytosol.Conversely, DNA vaccines (astrazeneca, JNJ) must first use the nucleus to turn their DNA into mRNA. This incurs so-called post-~translational~ (edit: post-transcriptional) modification to the genetic material prior to protein synthesis.As it turns out, some of these unforseen modifications create soluble spike protein fragments that bind to epithelial cells. This in turn causes inflammatory, and coagulant, activity, which leads to the lethal side effects that are sometimes observed.	isoprophlex	13.541942	5.77081	comment	5.0	35.0	1622115454	5.4825697

By calling the mRNA shot a vaccine , the WHO and CDC transferred such properties to the shot. That may have been great for encouraging adoption, but also comes with consequences particularly if two vaccine properties fail to hold, and a 3rd is not flawless.This was never made clear by anyone of relevance - instead the mantra was ""take the shots and all will be well"".  We oversold the solution.People took the shots, then behaved as if nothing else mattered. Dropped masks. Started going nuts.Now we see the results."

The primary protection against initial infection comes from antibodies, which are narrowly targeted. Other systems are more flexible, but don't kick in quickly enough to ward off a mild infection.And the takeaway is still: get vaccinated, get boosted.	snewman	13.728831	5.5885415	comment	5.0	30.0	1639765749	-15.044519

That is far too long for the timelines the EU wants.Then, even if such a judgment is forthcoming - you still aren't that much closer to getting more doses because as any solicitor will tell you, possession is nine tenths of the law and the doses are in the UK.

But then I learned that the Oxford trials PCR-tested every participant regularly, while the Pfizer and Moderna trials only tested participants that were showing symptoms. So there's a very real chance that behind that ~95% number the mRNA vaccines also had asymptomatic cases that were never discovered during trials, and the actual protection is nearly the same as the Oxford one. The mRNA vaccines still seem like a great leap forward, and they don't come with the potential complications of resistance to the vector virus that adenovirus-based vaccines do - but I'm less sure now that they actually offer better protection overall.	m12k	13.593849	5.7875133	comment	5.0	32.0	1611957657	5.4030623

But in the absence of data, masks being effective seems like a sensible default position to take.	nicoburns	13.705857	5.1769805	comment	5.0	52.0	1594819541	-11.531908

Moderna needs 2 doses which means only 500M protected per year which pages it to 16 years. I think the Oxford vaccine needs only 1 doses but because it uses a weakened virus there’s a chance a person develops covid-19.Then you need to administer something like 300 doses per second globally, if you have 1B doses.This is also assuming the virus doesn’t mutate during that time (it mutates very slowly but it could still happen).The vaccine really needs to give multi-year protection otherwise it won’t be viable in the long run.	remote_phone	13.536834	5.739906	comment	5.0	20.0	1595258067	5.356978

Apparently I'm in the minority in thinking that.But I put on a surgical mask, twist the side ear loop so that air comes out the side instead of the top (right at my eyes), and I ask myself what in the world it is supposed to be accomplishing.

As a somewhat plausible mechanism, repeated doses have been shown to induce IgG4 production, which non-mRNA vaccines don’t seem to do.Measles and Chickenpox are both airborne, although they’re not respiratory the way Covid is.

It doesn't actually make sense in most cases to use mRNA over traditional vaccines--but they have been producing fascinating non-prophylactic immunotherapy treatments with mRNA, where triggering a severe, and specific, immune response would lead to positive results (like with specifically targeted cancer treatments).

It is even very likely that the effect is going in the other direction.Even if you look hard, nowhere is it getting better - but there are quite a lot of places with massive trend-breaks in the wrong direction.Reasons:

This is an mRNA vaccine and is the first of it's kind to be widely offered. This appears to be different than the rest of the vaccines out there for other illnesses.2. There isn't a perceived benefit for many people: the vast majority of people won't get sick or be impacted in any way.3. It apparently doesn't stop people from getting or becoming transmissions vectors. So, if you get the vaccine and it makes you less sick, then you may take ""riskier"" actions than if you were to get it and actually have some symptoms. (IOW, why take it?)4.

My understanding is that many gene therapy studies have used blood cells, which can be pulled out of the body prior to gene therapy, the advances in viral vectors may be just as empowering as the therapy itself.  Imagine, in all the irony, getting “vaccines” as a child via viral vectors against common causes of poor health local to your birthplace.

The original paper, linked in the article mentions the mRNA messaging. Intuitively that roughly makes sense -- other cells might have the luxury of being able to directly talk to each other, through physical contact or proximity, but with neurons that is made more difficult due to the possibility of extending electric signals. So carrying information through mRNA might work, but I wonder why mRNA? Why not skip the middle man and go straight for proteins? What's the use of doing it this way? ik I'm anthropomorphizing but it seems to make more sense to just send out proteins to communicate? Or maybe mRNA allows for more finetuning on the other end, and is a more efficient mechanism, since it can be read dozens of times, instead of just being a handful of p"	ohtwenty	13.633146	5.858375	comment	6.0	19.0	1515858546	5.4958167

But what if a variant can arise with a highly compromised spike protein yet compensate enough to still be highly infectious due to other factors?The most interesting thing is to think about where the other empty spaces in our knowledge are that are yet to be filled in - what will we know this time	zmmmmm	13.555592	5.739015	comment	6.0	46.0	1636060410	5.5009418

The best evidence out there suggests a small impact (~11%) for surgical masks in an unvaccinated population, and none for cloth masks [1]The evidence quality is roughly as poor as that for ivermectin, vitamin D, etc., except that it has become a wildly political issue, fraught with propaganda to the point that most people will vehemently insist that the evidence quality is higher than it is. It is therefore deeply ironic that Slate is arguing about risk compensation, while using NPIs as an example of the kind of safety behavior being deterred by discussions of risk compensation.

So, why are there so many people not vaccinating their kids? Is there a portion of doctors who believe in this and advice against vaccinations to the parents? Or are the parents just ignoring doctors advice and choosing to not vaccinate by themselves? Or anything else?	pavanred	13.529095	5.67296	comment	7.0	33.0	1475079412	5.345474

The critical thing is that mRNA is extremely immunogenic -- that is, it provokes a strong immune response. Makes sense, since evolutionarily when we had little particles delivering RNA strands to our cells, they we viruses.So, that's great for vaccine production. Not so great for other diseases. Cystic fibrosis, for example, the body fails to make one specific protein. We (probably) can't just program it to produce that protein, because it would also train the immune system to target that protein. The best non-vaccine targets are probably cancer, where you want to get the immune system revved up against a tumor."	ProjectArcturis	13.613265	5.8282	comment	7.0	25.0	1619967149	5.4299264

Not to mention that this doesn't seem the same as ""while wearing a surgical mask you only get 11% increase in protection"" but is a population-level thing. There was still non-compliance that presumably lowered the efficacy. I would've intuitively guessed that the better fit of cloth masks would make them better, but presumably the mask surface of a surgical mask has properties that offset that?Would be great to see numbers for N95 masks. Intuitively I'd assume they'd be much more effective as they have better fit + higher filtration, but of course, confirmation would be great.Fits with what we're seeing in Europe such as airlines banning clo"	majormajor	13.742058	5.15563	comment	7.0	68.0	1630691905	-11.528327

If you are sick they can protect others around you, but if you are healthy, less so. In that context the flip of public opinion makes some sense: as we go from assuming most people are healthy to assuming most people are sick, masks for everyone in public can help.Also, don’t forget that in medical facilities N95 masks are fitted specifically to individuals. You can’t just throw one on and be protected. Most people won’t go through the trouble of doing that properly. At that point it’s like putting your shirt over your nose: looks like you are protected but there are giant gaps that let in air.	IgorPartola	13.701537	5.183085	comment	7.0	21.0	1585660897	-11.523197

President Trump sup­ported it and signed off on it. Azar brought in the DoD as well. (The bureaucratic history of OWS, like everything to do with it, is complex and contested.) Azar, Kushner, and others then made two hiring deci­sions that were crucial to Warp Speed’s success, recruiting Moncief Slaoui, a pharma executive, and Gustave F. Perna, a general, as its leaders. Slaoui, OWS’s chief adviser, had been chairman of global vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and brought pharma knowledge. General Perna, OWS’s chief operating officer, had overseen the global supply chains for the U.S. Army and brought logistical expertise	tomohawk	13.527622	5.69099	comment	8.0	132.0	1643580332	5.3649073

The fact is, molecular cell biology is incredibly complex and the models we have are just that, models.

Being pro-vaccine is senseless without being in favor of enough people being vaccinated  to provide strong immunity, including for those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical complications.Even if you were to argue on behalf of one who is indifferent to vaccines but is against mandates, so long as those mandates encourage vaccination, they effectively are discouraging vaccination and are thus anti-vax.It can be hard to recognize all of this without the right perspective.

The official response should be to make some form of improvised mask required when out of home, and ration regular mask for health care workers.Even a scarf made of a t-shirt over the nose and mouth will likely reduce RO when used at scale on the population. The best way to protect healthcare workers is to reduce the R0 below 1. Nothing else will help.

Given the large number of particles emitted upon respiration and especially upon sneezing or coughing (4), the number of respiratory particles that may penetrate masks is substantial, which is one of the main reasons leading to doubts about their efficacy in preventing infections. Moreover, randomized clinical trials show inconsistent or inconclusive results, with some studies reporting only a marginal benefit or no effect of mask use (5, 6).

In general I find them to be a minor inconvenience, although I believe they're more inconvenient for me than most because I'm blind and no matter what I do they always fog up my glasses.But while masks themselves are mildly inconvenient, harsh mask mandates and restrictions become much more of an annoyance quickly. Try taking a 6 hour flight with a 2 year old that's required to keep his mask on the entire flight, and when he takes it off (because he's 2, of course he's going to take it off) the flight attendants threaten to turn the plane around and ban you permanently.

Sputnik/AstraZeneca vaccines were released almost at the same time as Moderna/Pfizer. Yes, the latter were first commercial mRNA vaccines, but the technology is nevertheless rather mature. I watched a lecture by the people credited with creating mRNA vaccines and it turns out people have been working on the technology for decades.Now, the thing is that you can’t just sequence a virus, do bioinformatics, synthesize mRNA and package it into a nano particle. I mean, you can, but chances are it’s going to fail like the CureVac vaccine. The mRNA that gets packaged needs to be modified (I believe with alternative bases) to achieve desired effect.If mRNA vaccine was as magical as it was market	f6v	13.596919	5.8009953	comment	12.0	65.0	1643654522	5.361559

The problem with this is that if they told the public that this was how they were thinking about the problem, they wouldn't get people wearing the masks, so they overstated their confidence in it when speaking to the public.

One experiment you can do with the mask is go outside in cold weather, so that you can see the steam when you breathe. You will notice that when you breathe, most of air is actually escaping through the edges of the mask and around the nose.Also, there is a culture of not staying home when you're sick.

I was also under the impression that this was because making vaccines for viruses was much harder than other treatments because interrupting the viruses reproduction chain is essentially requiring you to interrupt your cell's reproduction chain.Is there some tool that has been used here that hasn't been available in the past?

Hesitant implies that people are weighing options and open to changing their minds. With the amount of time they have been available and the overabundance of evidence that the COVID vaccines are safe, effective, and that they decrease hospitalizations and death, I find it very hard to believe that anyone is still ""on the fence"" about it.> She thinks they’re taking it down because they don’t want people to know the truth.And there it is--this doesn't sound like a person who is weighing their options in good faith.

This is luckily no longer the case. However, medicine has not fully embraced the scientific method but some strange ""evidence-based"" variant.During the early stages of the pandemic, high ranking officials suggested we should not use masks because it was not yet ""proven"" the virus was transmitted via aerosols. And this was a catastrophic decision.We always need to reason under uncertainty. The correct interpretation of the scientific method would have led to the conclusion that COVID was likely to be transmitted via aerosols (e.g. due to sequence similarity with other coronaviruses, which are known to be transmitted via aerosols) and imposing mandatory masks (because t"	nextos	13.634102	5.2015367	comment	15.0	213.0	1637283487	-11.528357

Again, if you wear them properly and constantly, and everyone wears them.The people who DON'T want to wear them and who wish to make it a political act will dredge up all sorts of B.S studies and data showing that ""mandates"" don't work and therefore extrapolate from that that masks themselves don't work, when any examination of the scene will show 60% of people wearing them "	TheProbes	13.706838	5.1548877	comment	15.0	242.0	1638448473	-11.534371

If production could be increased that fast the manufacturers would.An important point the article didn’t address is that high prices direct resources to more important uses. If prices are very high then hospitals may be the only ones who can afford them, versus people on the street.Outlawing price gauging alone just ensures masks go to people who don’t need them as much as doctors. Price ceilings don’t force masks to go to doctors.

They can be disinfected in boiling water and if everybody uses them they will help to stop the spreading of the virus.In all the countries mentioned in the article people wear masks when in public, often just against pollution (i.e. Thailand).The moment we open our mouth we spread germs, even more so when we speak. And when we touch our nose or mouth, we have them on our hands.Thus entering a supermarket without a mask and without first disinfecting the hands should be forbidden.Social distancing is one thing, stopping the virus at the source is another and seemingly very effective measure	mcsb4	13.624306	5.1889057	comment	18.0	182.0	1585305491	-11.51701

If you're seriously trying to convince someone they're wrong, you need to be kind, be patient, and have a calm, productive discussion -- explaining how traditional vaccines work, how mRNA works, how DNA works, and so on.Yelling at someone on a mailing list will undoubtedly push them further into their comfortable anti-vax bubble.

And common sense dictates pretty convincingly that it must have some benefit, however small. So then why so much effort into deciding if it works or not?I suppose there are two answers to that question. One, health officials want to know if masks give a false sense of security so they can spend their time promoting measures that will actually make a difference. Two, folks just want a reason to avoid the minor inconvenience or, worse, have been led to believe that mask mandates seriously impinge upon their rights. My concern is that the most common answer is the second and articles like this only serve to confuse people at a time when we need to acc	davesque	13.741829	5.146329	comment	19.0	197.0	1593813912	-11.509588

I believe, however, that when national security is taken into account (ie having the ability for the country to rapidly respond to productive capacity needs in a time of crisis), the trade war along with serious investment in expanding industrial capacity is likely net good.	creddit	13.695705	5.0624123	comment	19.0	219.0	1584500690	-11.514913

That we should clean our doorknobs and vegetables, wash our hands, and avoid touching our face.

It is possible that Omicron is just as severe and that the effect in the study is because a large percentage of the population had some immunity from a previous infection or vaccine.> South Africa has a quite high seroprevalence of prior infection, particularly after delta, and in some parts of South Africa up to 80 percent of people were exposed to previous infection. We don’t think it’s a question of virulence, but more a question of exposure to vaccination and prior infection, so we would be cautious to try and interpret that this is a less virulent strain. We’ll have to see what happens in other parts of the world before we make a call on this.	ufo	13.715503	5.5750604	comment	23.0	321.0	1639495122	-15.037663

Meanwhile, the UK and US do not export any vaccines at all. So just as a back of the envelope calculation, with 41 millionen doeses the EU could have vaccinated an additional 10% of its population, while the UK would have had more than 10% less vaccinatetions without those 8 million. This would not completetly close the gap, but the numbers would be quite different then.Anyway, you can interpret this in a postivie way: the EU is trying to be good and is sharing its vaccinations more or less fairly with other countries (for now).

If everyone on the planet got the J&J vaccine tomorrow, and if it is the cause of the clots, then 6,971 people would die from the vaccine.Yesterday, Covid19 killed 8,803 people (according to worldometers).We don't want anyone to die from vaccination, and we don't fully understand what the clotting issue is, so it probably makes sense to pause using J&J as long as the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) have not been implicated (which they haven't). OTOH, if this being in the news causes fewer people to get vaccinated, pausing it may be a mistake that will cause more overall deaths.Now, your risk of dying either from vaccination or Covid19 depends on vari	js2	13.526844	5.735563	comment	23.0	231.0	1618341684	5.315279

People hear “5x as infectious” and reason that due to the nature of exponential models, that much more than 5x people will be infected. This is extremely incorrect. In truth, far fewer than 5x people will be infected over the long term. And again, no, this is not because it’s hitting the upper limits of 100% of the population or anywhere near that.I won’t be so bold as to say it’s probable, but given this is not a novel virus, it’s entirely believable to say that 	oneoff786	13.681771	5.5680375	comment	24.0	169.0	1640204569	-15.041866
