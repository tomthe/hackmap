It's been part of many courses and many rounds of Google Summer of Code. It's an embeddable kernel + OS free of the cancerous GPL, under a permissive MIT licence. It is extremely well documented, well tested, and consistent. Writing drivers for it is very simple. This makes it interesting for education, for-profit development, embedded applications, etc...It's also just fun. There is a very active forum[1], wiki[2], and community[3] that has been spiting out hobby OSs for a decade. The kernel originally used in Haiku is from NewOS, a project by Travis Geiselbrecht that was also just a hobby project.[1]: http://forum.osdev.org/[2]: http://wiki.osdev.org/[3]: irc://chat.freenode.net:6667/#osd	TkTech	17.100773	5.6848207	comment	3.0	21.0	1474656745	15.554929

They also demonstrate that it does not take dozens of corporate paid engineers to do it ( not that I would turn them away ).Haiku has a long lead over Serenity in terms of hardware support and now app compatibility ( with the new X11 and Wayland stuff ). That said, having to drag along binary compatibility with BeOS must really be slowing Haiku down at this point.I am looking forward to using one or both of them in the future.

It could do things that neither Windows NT, Linux or MacOS (pre- OSX) could do, and it could do it even on very limited hardware.Nowadays, I think that if Haiku could be ported to ARM, it would become a very interesting alternative for any kind of SOC-based appliance where you'd need more than a microcontroller but something like Linux/Android is overkill: smart TVs, audio/video receivers, smart home hubs, some cool guitar sound effect pedal, etc...	rglullis	17.1008	5.684984	comment	3.0	10.0	1481988718	15.553816

The interface actually has a certain depth and this is consistent across icons, windows, dialogs, menus, buttons, etc. It's a shame that interfaces nowadays are completely flat. They are almost... expressionless and with the exception of the odd drop shadow they completely lack a third dimension. When I first learned of Haiku (and BeOS), back when Gnome was in the 2.x days, I was so impressed by the interface that I installed a look-alike desktop and icon theme. I used it for quite a long time until GTK+ 3.x eventually became prevalent.	spystath	17.09876	5.6817136	comment	3.0	89.0	1543778667	15.555084

BeOS (and therefore Haiku) had some neat features like a database built into the FS, was designed to take advantage of multiprocessor systems, and put a lot of effort into providing great multimedia capabilities.From my perspective, the project seemed to have been taken over by Linux Desktop people, introduced a package manager, and I completely lost interest in it. In that respect, it's basically a much less functional Linux distro.	AnIdiotOnTheNet	17.100636	5.68444	comment	4.0	58.0	1530538969	15.551467

The look-n-feel of it seems better to me than any other UI I've seen, and I say that as someone who never used BeOS, so it's not the nostalgia talking.It would be really cool if Haiku was able to get to a state were it's usable as a daily driver. I think having an OS and interface more focused on a single user at a graphical terminal rather than a multi-user system with graphics tacked on would be positive.BeFS also has some really great ideas that aren't replicated in other more modern FSes, namely it includes database-like functionality that enables some really neat features via a standardized interface, rather than hiding them away in vendor-specific file formats.

39627030	Haiku OS in my opinion solves this b	Haiku OS in my opinion solves this better by basing everything on default font size (in pixels). Eg it defaults to 12px, I used 20px for a 3840x2160 monitor. Some GUI widgets scale based on this. All text (when using be_default_font) scale based on this. Spacing / layout depends on this. The key difference (compared to a global x1.5 scaling factor) is that developers of each app decide how to use this information, so different parts of the GUI are scaled disproportionatily. Sloppy apps ignore this, but the devs are quickly notified. So you end up with text larger but GUI widgets can grow dis-proportionatily, so you can fine tune what is 125%, 150%, etc. Eg. ScrollBar can be 125%, toolbar 150%, text 233%. Haiku has had this since the beginning (even BeOS in the 90’s had this).

Case in point - the Medo media editor which does 4K videos, dozens of OpenGL pluggins and binary addons, and the entire multilingual package is 1.28Mb.
