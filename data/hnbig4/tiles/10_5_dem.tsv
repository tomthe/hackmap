Profiting from a disparity in pricing between buyers and sellers is always a touchy subject. The usual justification is the service of connecting sellers and buyers. One can honestly wonders if buyers and sellers really would not have found each other otherwise.* How much is the match-making worth. One person does the actual work, one is doing the referal. How much is referal worth? 1%, 5%, 20%, 50%? Most people value referral pretty low, right or not.* Driving prices down. By making markets more efficient, it creates a race to the bottom.

But initially, Urbit was this [2]:> Urbit is a new programming and execution environment designed from scratch. Any resemblance to existing languages or operating systems is coincidental, cosmetic, or inevitable.It was based on this idea: suppose that a different civilization (Martians specifically) had invented computing long before humans. Then by now they would have perfected it. What would their system look like? Urbit is an attempt to rethink computing without the bias of human research and our current intuition.

For example:- webserver: I used to run a personal web server, and then I noticed that I have to throttle the speed to avoid ending up with a huge bill, and when the colo is down, the server is down. I keep all my data in the cloud now, and due to economy of scale, I do not have to worry about availability, ping times, or bandwidth limits. How can personal server compete with CDNs?- I also used to run my own mailserver, and it was always a pain to keep spam away.

She was an important and respected voice in ecommerce, especially for small business owners who often struggled to choose between different online platforms. When she offered critique to a particular platform, it was always measured, well-reasoned, and fair.All the Etsians that I'm still in touch with were horrified and outraged when we learned of this story.	notpachet	5.373001	-1.616818	comment	4.0	14.0	1627994039	-14.916824

If an org is full of superstars, the org still has to ensure it has at least X% turnover per year, so a superstar has to go. Usually well-performing devs whose manager wasn't skilled enough to convince the larger group that all of their people are superstars.It's cruel, unfair, and harms the company far more than it has ever helped them.The second problem is that sociopaths can and do abuse it. There isn't supposed to be a way for a manager to fire someone on a PIP when they ask for a transfer. There's also at least one manager in the Toronto office who openly brags that he does it.

The correct response to receiving a PIP, probably in most SV companies, is to start looking for another job.It's easy to turn your own logic back around on you. Since it's a more-or-less open secret that most PIPs are part of managed termination, every competent company that issues one knows they're running a huge risk of sabotaging their relationship with an employee by issuing one. There are lots of ways to manage improved performance from an employee without invoking the dreaded PIP.

The old discussion is still relevant for a project as long-term as this, and the more recent you get the more Urbit is misunderstood or attacked simply for being different.Years on from the first announcements this hugely ambitious project is finally showing real-world practical application that is already superior to the alternatives in some dimensions, and with great potential for growth.

Hopefully some urbit people could address those, since claiming to be a secure personal VM and just exposing your data on disk to the cloud provider is crazy.Other than that, the author seems to be mostly making fun of urbit for being weird and alien, which is strange because its goal basically seems to be weird and alien. This is actually quite excellent. Computing needs fewer javascript frameworks and more truly weird and alien shit, with a healthy dose of NIH.	voldacar	5.6080112	-2.3086374	comment	5.0	29.0	1621885586	15.06703

We send and receive packages pretty much every day, it’s been great for them during the pandemic.Depop has done a great job fostering a more human experience than other platforms. That’s definitely a huge factor in their success.Buying and selling is pretty involved. Haggling is super common. If you’re selling many items, people will message you and ask for bundle deals. If you’re a regular, sometimes people will just throw you a discount. If you just buy something silently, you’ll often get a short thank-you message.There’s a culture around the packaging, too. People tend to put candies, stickers, hand-written thank-you notes, extra things the seller doesn’t need anymore.

All of these concepts have their own weird names; for instance, the constant-time version of ""decrement"" (this is a programming environment that goes out of its way to achieve constant-time decrement†) is an example of a ""jet"", where a jet is apparently a non-native implementation of an algorithm that can be "	tptacek	5.6138296	-2.3125043	comment	5.0	35.0	1505964916	15.103345

It doesn't help that people who spend time in that land seem to all forget how to speak about it except in the terms of Urbit, unable to translate it for laypeople.

Chief technology officer Chad Dickerson had taken over as CEO after Kalin was voted out by the board in July 2011, and in October 2013, in an infamous town hall meeting at Etsy HQ, he announced that the company would allow sellers to contract with outside manufacturers to help make their products, so long as they designed everything themselves and were willing to provide detailed explanations of their process to Etsy’s Marketplace Integrity team.Much of the community was aghast, fearing the change would ruin the culture of the site forever.	heymijo	5.3695135	-1.6173421	comment	6.0	24.0	1567773450	-14.915043

Starting from a small clique of like-minded people.Now it's possible to understand what the idea is (some sort of VM running an esoteric set of languages to build an operating system that, among other things serves as a 'digital identity' of sorts).

It is frustrating and obnoxious, but I can't say it is surprising given the policy changes they've been rolling out the past few months.It seems to me that online marketplaces like Etsy find their early success by bringing buyers and sellers together and just letting them do their thing, but as the marketplace becomes more established it's relationship with sellers inevitably turns adversarial.I feel like we need some form of regulation to limit how marketplaces like Etsy can dictate how their sellers conduct business.  Amazon has a program that allows ""business"" customers to place an order and pay the invoice 30 days later.  Since Amazon only pays out every 2 weeks, this means I can be made to wait up to 6 weeks to "	MicahKV	5.3702946	-1.6176004	comment	11.0	84.0	1582779844	-14.957208

I used to buy from Etsy all the time, but at this point, I have zero trust that I would actually be buying something handmade from a real, independent creator. Which of course means I just won't buy from them at all. I don't know why Etsy seems to welcome this instead of doing everything they possibly can to fight it.	elefantastisch	5.370742	-1.6168697	comment	13.0	137.0	1649693153	-14.917561

They’re just reselling the stuff at a healthy markup. Is that allowed now? I thought it was all supposed to be handmade or vintage or whatever?	gnicholas	5.3697534	-1.6178056	comment	13.0	49.0	1607454533	-14.9151535

I've heard stories of people completing PIP programs successfully, but quite honestly, I don't get it. Once you got to that point, you're not a good fit to the team and/or they don't appreciate you. Makes no sense to stay. I could understand staying with the company & switching teams/departments, but staying in the same place makes no sense to me.	virgilp	5.860828	-2.0078256	comment	14.0	83.0	1570085010	15.25626

They want to get rid of a person, but they're afraid of getting sued, so a PIP is a way to document why a person was fired in the case of litigation.This practice seems pretty common in California, but given California is an at-will employment state, I'm not even sure why.	mattbillenstein	5.859939	-2.0053768	comment	14.0	71.0	1499275758	15.254451

If you have a very competitive interview process and high compensation to attract the best talent, it is unlikely you have so many underperformers lying about to cull annually.So really it's overhiring BS that is then getting taken out on employees.

If they're trying to apply ML to managing customer recommendations, they should figure out how to identify who's actually selling legitimate wares.I stopped buying from Etsy a couple years ago - I purchased my SO what I thought was a unique, interesting ""handcrafted"" necklace.
