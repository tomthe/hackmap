The interesting bit in this article is not necessarily the sum of the ransom, but that Colonial decided to pay quasi-immediately. It seems as if the attackers had full control over their network. Another possibility: Colonial staff could not be sure that if they used their backups, everything  would be encrypted immediately again - possibly the backup servers as well.

Do you think they are sending people some AES key and then everyone goes off and builds some python tool to decrypt his data?This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the ransomware business. The whole reason people pay up is because the hackers don't run and leave you hanging; if you pay they will decrypt your data.

It then encrypts K1 itself using some public key Kpub embedded in the ransomware, then stores the encrypted K1 on disk. When the user pays the ransom, they receive the corresponding private key Kpriv that allows them to decrypt K1, which then lets them decrypt all their files.I think what this tool does is read the unencrypted K1 directly from memory, which means Kpriv is no longer needed.EDIT: One correction: the user doesn't receive Kpriv, instead they send the encrypted K1 to the ransomware owner who decrypts it and	ahomescu1	4.8696074	3.3052404	comment	3.0	14.0	1495223470	-5.056417

(With the exception of 0-days, but you can't blame anyone falling victim to that)My point is, the ransomware is just 'prove' that your computer is insecure. If criminals can encrypt your files, they can also steal it (i.e. upload it somewhere). So in some sense, the ransomware creators expose vulnerabilities that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Attackers are surely savvy to this, and should set the ransom to be slightly lower than what they estimate the fine would be, which 'motivates' the organisation to pay the ransom.In theory however, even if the organisation recovers the data by paying the ransom, they should still report this as a data breach, and would probably be fined by the regulator even though the data was recovered, since the breach still occurred in the first place.I'd be very interested to know the impact the new California stat	p0llard	4.8710876	3.3047912	comment	6.0	32.0	1592062398	-5.0427756

I'm assuming that there was a significant number of victims in this attack. Were they targeting developers? Or did they just happen to comb through all this data and find what looked to be source code / git repositories.The other thing I find interesting is this comment:> We’re working on the assumption that there’s no point in paying — the attacker has no reason to keep their end of the bargain.If you really want to be successful in exploiting people through cyber attacks, I guess you will need some kind of system to provide guaranteed con	joshaidan	4.87143	3.3034358	comment	6.0	40.0	1495082635	-5.00679

I contacted Kafeine about this and he  linked me to the following freshly posted tweet made by ProofPoint researcher Darien Huss, who stated the opposite (that our registration of the domain had actually stopped the ransomware and prevent the spread).That's quite an high abstraction level programming thing to do to use a domain name registration state as a boolean.

And to preempt people who are going to chime in with ""Sony was just some insider leaking data"" there is extensive evidence showing it was the work of a previously unidentified APT group.

20230082	Could they have avoided the ransom b	Could they have avoided the ransom by having daily (or hourly) backups to non-rewritable (write once) media? So the malware won’t encrypt the backups, obviously.I think that the last day’s work (or last hour’s work) will be lost or will require a lot of manual fixing regardless of whether they pay the ransom. If they pay, they’ll still have to fix partial database transactions, corrupt files, etc., for the attack date. If they don’t pay, they can recover from earlier good backups and reconstruct that one day’s worth. My reasoning is that the attack date’s data is going to be corrupt and untrustworthy in either case, and it’ll be equal work either way. (Or at least it’ll be less than $600,000 of work to fix that one day.)I imagine that they either weren’t doing backups at all, or their back	mysterypie	4.8539314	3.3171995	comment	8.0	49.0	1561007492	-5.0391817

However this is not guaranteed and you should never pay!What bothers me about their advice is that it is only correct macroeconomically. For your particular case it could be the best solution to just pay - as even police departments have done before.It also ignores that it is in cybercriminals' best interest to let you decrypt after you paid: They need their victims to trust them, and they have nothing to gain from keeping the files encrypted after payment.	toennisforst	4.8708043	3.30451	comment	9.0	76.0	1477856639	-5.0606313

But for certain kinds of data -- photos, video, large media -- can you really afford to do any other kind of strategy?The other question I have is related to that first point: since ransomware can't encrypt everything all at once, how is it possible for your system to continue to function?

Their #1 goal is saving people's lives, not messing with IT issues. You want hospitals to be paying for important equipment, important people, important skills.

But this kinda shows the response I was referencing to.A lot of people like to think of ransomware attacks as the ultimate stress test as far as security goes, and thus a good thing - but let's not get too blinded by our professions (most probably in tech), these kinds of attacks can have serious consequences: Imagine if some foreign state agency (masquerading as hackers) launches a multiheaded attack on, say, utilities plants - in the middle of the winter.

Dismissing this because companies should do better security is like dismissing doctors because people should get more exercise. That's silly. We need preventative care and treatment.I'm not surprised by this announcement because the way that the pipeline-company ransomware hackers beat a hasty retreat was noticeably unusual, and already seemed to telegraph that the state was getting involved more...actively.
