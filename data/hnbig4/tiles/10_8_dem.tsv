33088829	Quadcopters have short flight times 	Quadcopters have short flight times because they need to use batteries. Commercial helicopters regularly have 3+ hours of flight time.(Of course, Lillium's aircraft is battery-powered. But it's not fair to say that an aircraft capable of VTOL will always have a dramatically reduced endurance compared to a non-VTOL aircraft, especially since this one can transition to fixed-wing flight.)	zlsa	5.8034163	1.9968774	comment	3.0	13.0	1664927214	6.0305996

33098440	If the fairing was just a little bit	If the fairing was just a little bit longer on the Falcon 9 it could easily launch another one of these. But the dang thing cost $4.3 billion just to build and launch so I can see why they would want to repair instead of re-build. Especially since Dragon is so freaking cheap compared to the shuttle. However, outfitting Dragon for EVA would be a freaking PITA considering the certification process. More likely they would have to launch an EVA module separately that Dragon would dock to that had the necessary airlock to remove the need to depressurize Dragon.I could see them designing a cheaper less dear version of Hubble now that launch costs are so much lower. But repairing it definitely makes a lot of sense.	foxyv	5.882066	1.165768	comment	3.0	15.0	1664990517	6.134932

They either shoot the missile down or, if they don't manage to because it flies overhead too quickly, call the next guy in the direction it flew to, informing them that a missile is incoming for that direction (it will be a short time, 1-2 minutes). So the next guy will be fully prepared and knows where to look. That simple.If missiles flew too high for MANPADS, they'd be very easily shot down by proper SAMs or fighters, they survive by flying under the radar."	anovikov	5.9939737	2.1598012	comment	3.0	12.0	1665401630	6.058959

He saw an increase in signal strenghth when a plane overflew his position and reflected some of the signal.Modern SAM systems are said to have the capability to track targets passively, for example by using reflected DVB-T transmissions. This is very important because combat aircraft have radar warning receivers, and it's best to not tell the enemy you're engaging him so that he can use countermeasures or perform evasive manoeuvres. Also SEAD/DEAD (suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses) is near impossible unless you can first locate the enemy air defense radars, which becomes a lot harder if you cannot simply home in on strong RF emitters.

33338158	The rx/tx separation in over-the-hor	The rx/tx separation in over-the-horizon radars (OTHR) serves to increase isolation between the transmitter and receiver.  The received signal is tiny, as it has not only bounced off the target but done a double bounce off the ionosphere.  Doppler shifts are also very small, so one needs to minimise the clutter at zero Hertz, and a direct signal will appear as zero Hz clutter.You can get an idea of the precision of the timing required by considering how far a radio wave travels in a unit of time corresponding to the uncertainty in your time source and comparing that to the repetition period of the waveform.  OTHRs typically have large ranges and use long period waveforms to minimise range ambiguity, so the timing requirements probably aren't too bad.Summary: A passive OTHR should be doable	femto	5.971756	1.8817594	comment	3.0	10.0	1666744409	5.9853544

If you were operating in an opposite orbit you'd have a ~35km/sec closing velocity.

First they developed launch systems that targeted the middle of the space launch system that weren't terribly ""high tech"" but were designed with cost optimization in mind.  Then they developed a real business,  and they pursued re-usability in a conservative way as a further cost optimization.After all of that (and capturing a huge amount of the market) SpaceX began development of a truly radical system that promises much better capabilities and lower cost.Blue Ocean has made the mistake that many entrants in this market have made by developing a super high tech system (reusable from the start) rather than taking minimal steps.The market for orbital flights is real,  the market for sub-orbital flights is not.

Biggest difference is that the Standard uses normal 2.4ghz wifi for remote -> phone -> drone communication, so it gets interfered with heavily and has a very reduced range because of that (comparatively, the Mavic can like miles while the Standard you'd be really pushing it at just a mile).The Mavic is a ridiculously cool little device, so much better for traveling too.	dchuk	5.7892156	2.0237534	comment	3.0	17.0	1502762115	6.3441815

HOWEVER, as proposed, it is no real competition with high speed rail. In fact, in my opinion, Musk missed the point of high speed rail entirely. It is less about getting from LA to SF quickly than it is about getting from Bakersfield to SF or from Fresno to LA. High speed rail links LA to SF as well as ALL POINTS IN BETWEEN. It creates a single economic corridor. Hyperloop on the other hand just links two points much the same way as air travel. This, coupled with the massive disparity in capacity that you pointed out, makes it ridiculous to compare Musk's hyperloop to high speed rail; it is more comparable to air travel.	goodcanadian	6.1399746	1.6504121	comment	3.0	15.0	1476461655	4.4741

You definitely can't do it with a quadcopter, which doesn't have anywhere near the precision reaction capability to counteract rifle recoil. Even the most advanced fighter jets in existence right now can't do this. They need to use guide missiles for precision targeting.In practice, a drone swarm is an area weapon. It's why it's kamikaze and relies on explosives right now. It can say it has the ability to find a specific person using computer vision and maybe it can, but it definitely can't make sure it only kills that one person and it can't kill from a distance.No flying platform will be replacing snipers any time soon.	nonameiguess	5.8172994	2.045228	comment	3.0	15.0	1623856595	6.3074703

Or even place a charge, back off, detonate it, then place a second charge on the same spot and detonate that.

Basically, you don't get free laminar flow right at the skin of the vehicle. If you want to use a control surface it has to be big enough to stick far enough out into the fluid to deflect enough air (or water) to be effective.Boundary layer thickness doesn't scale linearly with size, which is why small scale model rockets can make effective use of fins, whereas the full-sized vehicle cannot.Combine this with the fact that, as the OP discuss"	GlenTheMachine	5.8761187	1.3115546	comment	3.0	16.0	1505500481	5.896031

If you are leaving London, this means you can leave at a reasonable time, and have plenty of useful business meetings in New York: Much better the subsonic flight. But what happens when you fly in the other direction? In practice, it's 8 hours. So leave NYC at 8 am in the morning, and by the time you are at an office in London, the workday is over: Far less valuable for an executive than the other direction.

The Falcon 9 is a serious rocket with 9 on the same engine (hence the name) which came later.As for the contract, it was a $1.6B contract, not small. And sure, it wasn't a grant, something was expected in return, but in practice, it was essentially the same, SpaceX wouldn't have been able to survive without it, and grant or contract, had they missed the chance, it would have been the end. Also, the US regularly gives new contracts to SpaceX, and I suspect at an inflated price compared to purely commercial launches. In theory, these are not subsidies, but in practice, I can't imagine NASA and the US government not do anything in their power to keep SpaceX healthy as they don't have anything better by far.

Of course, once at cruising altitude, it needed to have enough fuel to finish the trip, which was about 60 tons. The empty mass of Concorde was 75 tons, plus passengers and cargo, let's say about 110-120 tons. Imagine now that instead of pushing from the ground 180 tons, you only push 120 tons and refuel once you get there. That means you burn one third less fuel during takeoff. Not only that, you can have smaller engines, which means lighter construction in general, so less weight, etc. It's a virtuous cycle.Aerial refueling, if it can be fully automated, and made routine, and supersafe, could be revolutionary for civilian aircraft.	credit_guy	5.6522717	1.876327	comment	3.0	16.0	1700966732	5.8238835

This is far from ideal because multiple small engines gives poorer power to weight than fewer big engines, but SpaceX hoped to gain cost advantages by mass producing the engines.The original plan for recovering the F9 first stage was to use parachutes and this was tried with the first couple of launches, but the boosters broke up on re-entry.

The article briefly mentions how radar can actively detect the doppler shift of targets. If you think about it, the doppler shift of the ground would be neutral, right? Or roughly the speed of the aircraft. So lets say you've been locked on by a fighter at high altitude and they've fired a radar seeker at you.

The minimum fuel cost is a very small fraction of the cost of launching with current launch vehicles.  The costs come from expendability and manufacturing and non-fuel operating costs.

This is how much one should be willing to spend to save one expected life.  It's a vital number for planning purposes.  For example, should we install a guard rail at this corner?  Is controlling this release of this chemical justifiable?  Compute if the cost is less than the expected value of lives saved.  If so, spend the money, if not, don't.The usual statistical value of a human life is around $10M.  And you immediately see the problem:  a rocket that costs $1B to launch is, in effect, killing 100 statistical people just by being launched.

He explained that there are diminishing returns on mission success rates so NASA often had the choice of paying X per mission attempt  each with an 80% success rate or 2X for a single launch with 95% success rate. 80% sounds bad but the chance of two launches failing is 4%, which means a 96% chance overall success rate. If the first launch succeeds, they can usually save between 20-40% of the total budget (the remaining amount is overhead to build backups and keep scientists and engineers employed in case the first launch fails). However, since NASA is no longer doing world shattering stuff like landing on the moon, the human echo chamber amplifies each failure and drowns out the successes.

Most of the other commercial uses (such as in medicine, welding, diving, etc.) tend to use smaller amounts of helium and do not lose the helium after one usage.

Seen as a start toward refinement of inner character (of a shuttle-like craft) from the outside-in, Buran makes much more sense.	themodelplumber	5.956125	1.5987625	comment	3.0	23.0	1549005816	-13.424913

Food is one canonical example, best illustrated here:  https://idlewords.com/2007/04/the_alameda_weehawken_burrito_...Burritos are particularly robust to delivery (along with Pizza, Chinese takeaway, and curries).  Most finer meals, and even items such as sandwiches or hamburgers, aren't.  I don't see a large market for duck a l'orange avec quadcopter however.Even food deliveries, though, probably don't pass the sniff test.For me, seeing some new fancy tech prototype or proposal that looks to be unsuited to general commercial or residential use, I tend to see a submarine military application.

28070336	Noise pollution may be a reason dron	Noise pollution may be a reason drone delivery _shouldn't_ happen, but don't confuse that with an actual practical obstacle. In the US, at least, the airspace (including drones) is regulated at a federal level by the FAA, and their mandate doesn't really include residential noise levels. For example, I've never seen noise levels discussed when it comes to private aviation, even though small planes can _definitely_ be loud enough to affect quality of life (they don't even have mufflers...) Drone regulations seem to be following a similar trajectory, with categories and rules based on mass and prop guards, and no formal measurements of perceptual noise at all.For stationary noise concerns like a highway being built, it's possible for local communities to rally and be heard, but it's entirely	HALtheWise	5.786586	2.0309815	comment	3.0	10.0	1628143062	6.434809

It seems like a perfect way to derisk the notion of reusable launch systems while providing a native-to-SpaceX revenue stream (orbital internet provision).Assuming that they can achieve the success rates they've been aiming for, demonstrating lowered risk and cost through their own deployments will provide about the best advertisement you could possibly imagine. Waiting for organic outside demand to fill the launch roster to the same point would take time that Musk clearly does not want to waste. It seems to be a Keynesian approach to the slightly Chicken/Egg problem of commercial space.	BWStearns	5.9299564	1.1847823	comment	3.0	16.0	1479349891	6.0766

Lacking an APU is an exception when it comes to jet aircraft and necessitates a few changes. Relevant here is that an APU can provide power in an emergency, so the role is played by the hydrazine powered EPU for the F-16.This makes hydrazine somewhat more of a rational choice for something you expect to use rarely. If it were expected to be frequently used then it would have to be frequently refilled and that would necessitate all ground crew wearing the full body hazmat suits you see in the photo for the X-37b here as well as many other complex safety precautions.The F-35 has a conventionally jet fuelled APU[0]	agurk	5.7832327	2.2183897	comment	3.0	11.0	1572220856	6.019313

That was an insanely difficult GNC task which took so many iterations to perfect out...Plus yes, on landing they didn't have a second chance as rocket couldn't hover - minimum engine thrust was bigger  than it's mass so if it  missed, it either crashed, or flew back up	anovikov	5.887094	1.2058785	comment	3.0	14.0	1572514036	6.0227304

In the case of drones, I am afraid that the systems design to make these devices acceptably safe is yet to be formulated (Note: these are not planes, they fly close to the ground so they do not benefit from the safety of altitude to have time to react in case of failure)	crocal	5.8064976	2.0287013	comment	3.0	23.0	1575374404	6.252465

This would, in my mind, let them do a soft touchdown via autorotation in case of sudden engine failure at any point of the landing maneuver (at least if the pilot has fast enough reflexes).

And there I don't see any systematic advantage that would explain the lower prices SpaceX is advertising.I know that there is no such thing as a ""standard"" launch, but all numbers that are available point at higher prices than the $ 62M a Falcon 9 is advertised for.Reusable launchers are different story.

And also they tend to lie on their drone encounters. No actual drone incident has even been reported where the owner of the drone was not violating an obvious rule (either line of sight or zoning), ie the rules don't need to change.The other thing to consider is that drones are not more dangerous than birds, and they don't fly near airports and they don't form flocks.Now there will be way more use for small UAV than manned aviation, so one logical thing to do is strictly separate the airspace (400ft- for drones 500ft+ for planes, increase 100ft every 5 years) by preventing manned aircrafts from flying low, in particular o	nraynaud	5.7946506	2.0211554	comment	3.0	16.0	1539024565	6.325951

It dreamt of MIG-21s falling out of the sky before they even saw the US fighter. That fighter was the F-4 and it did not get a cannon. It did not get a cannon, because its missiles were so advanced that it did not need one - it would spot the MIG-21/19 and shoot it out of the sky before the lighter, more agile plane (with an inferior radar) got close. Except that didn't happen. Some blame lack of approval-to-fire on target that isn't visually identified, but the reality is that the tech wasn't there.Now it is.

The cost of planes, and pilots, is so high that almost all the effort spent these days is on killing your enemy with over-the-horizon weapons fired from hundreds of miles away. AI-powered dogfighting in aircraft is military marketing.People have been claiming that over-the-horizon missiles will obsolete dog-fighting since before the Vietnam war:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_F6D_Missileer> Through the later part of the 1950s and into the 1960s, military air planners increasingly believed that future air combat would be carried out almost entirely by long-range missile fire.

A single AIM-9X Sidewinder missile comes at $400k, about the price of a brand new Cessna. A fixed wing drone under $100k is not inconceivable (drones don't have to support pilots, so all sorts of failure modes are acceptable, as opposed to what's ok for a Cessna). It would be within the capabilities of many nations' armed forces to send swarms of thousands of such drones. Shooting them down with missiles will be both expensive and impractical. The only realistic way to defend against swarms of cheap drones is to use your own cheap(ish) drones that can out-dogfigth them.	credit_guy	5.8567634	2.1033905	comment	3.0	23.0	1642522086	6.167441

The problem in shooting down an inbound maneuvering hypersonic isn't reaction time.  It doesn't matter how quickly you see that the target has changed course.  Hypersonics are a matter of commitment.  Once the interceptor is launched it is committed to very narrow cone of potential trajectories.  If the inbound hypersonic makes a slight turn, it is then outside that cone.  The interceptor cannot physically alter its course enough to hit the new trajectory.  It lacks the energy (delta-V) to make such a change.  AI cannot create delta-V out of thin air.A computer can spot a track, project its likely path and guide an interceptor missile.

In addition, with modern missiles, even a stealth fighter is an easy target now they use the newer multi emitter radar.

The probability of getting at least one satellite in orbit with the latter scenario is ~96%, higher than than the $500mil/launch option, with an 80% chance of saving 25-75% of the budget for the second launch (depending on scheduling and staff retention costs for that mission).The problem with the latter option is th	civilitty	5.876201	1.12418	comment	3.0	12.0	1531366497	6.231457

The top racing motors these days produce 1.6kg of thrust at max output and consume 40 amps of power in the process.  It's not difficult to produce a quad under 500 grams.4 motors would produce 6.4kg of total thrust for a 500 gram quad for a nearly 12.8:1 thrust/weight ratio at a 160 amp current draw.  A few years ago a 4:1 thrust/weight ratio was considered pretty good.160 amps might be a stretch, but it's not uncommon to get >100A out of a 1300mah battery.All that is pretty crazy, but I think the more interesting bits are in the open source efforts around flight controllers and speed controllers.	halbritt	5.8628635	2.080056	comment	3.0	12.0	1517333074	4.7111096

This means intercepting a plane or helicopter attacking the front lines (launching missiles from a distance) puts the radar very close to the front.Lancet has a range of about 30 miles, so if you place your SAMs close enough to intercept the planes, they are now in striking distance of the Lancet.

It is also what makes the Starship work both more credible and more interesting. There are a lot of technical problems to work through on Starship between now and it being as reliable as say Falcon is, but if (when?) they get there, the ability to put 100 tons into LEO for just the cost of the propellant and some depreciation on the vehicle?

That’s not a deal breaker, but it’s certainly a hurdle. If you’ve been next to someone on a plane who had to down a whole bottle of xanax (metaphorically) just to get through the flight, you realize how traumatic it can be for some people.And then you’ll get stories like “mother of five perishes with all five due to airship failure”. Tesla has had relatively few such horror stories, and look how much it’s impacted them. (On the other hand, “how little it’s impacted them” might also be accurate.)But I really want to know what you mean by airship. My mind immediately went to FF7 Highwind.	sillysaurusx	5.4140015	1.7029681	comment	3.0	14.0	1657996278	-11.599295

They would face the same problem the Boeing 2707 team had (or even Lockheed with the L-2000 project), no matter how they tried, too short range for trans-pacific in one Hop.

This could mean the capsule was going faster than it should have before its parachute deploy or it didn't slow down enough when hitting the water which would be worse.Finally the main parachutes where touching each other pretty aggressively it wouldn't seem than unfathomable that two or more of them get tangled up, I don't think there is a backup solution for if that happens.	soheil	5.9181724	1.2426782	comment	3.0	32.0	1579450798	5.7721157

Around the turn of the century barely before the GWOT the air force realized the wings were failing so fast they'd run out of replacement wings around 2010, so right after the GWOT started (which is getting to be one human generation ago...) they rushed a contract thru to slap repairs on the existing wings and then replace entirely with new wings.  As of late 2010s the wing replacement project (about $2B) and the air force desire to get rid of the A10 were dueling with each other, kinda crazy.  AFAIK that battle continues today.

When the Starliner started a burn at the wrong time, a crew would have been able to stop it and prevent the loss of fuel.

It's just too expensive here.The Turks aren't succeeding because they're building better drones. They're succeeding because the market for drones is disposable, and so the quality doesn't need to be as high - in many cases it's better to have a lower price.China didn't succeed because they can make better T-shirts than the US. They succeeded because they made cheaper T-shirts.Don't confuse the two.	onlyrealcuzzo	5.890892	2.1570215	comment	3.0	10.0	1708521002	6.447521

Yes, some technical know-how here and there was technically ""lost""--I've been in North Hollywood scrounging around for old NASA parts so that measurements could be taken and worked backwards from.But even if we had that know-how, we wouldn't do it the same again. From novel materials to simulations to communications and onboard computing, modern spacecraft deserved to be redesigned. (For the counterfactuals, see ULA and Arianespace.)So until someone (SpaceX) started eating that node-transition cost, we entered a period of apparent stasis.

They were already banned from overflying Manhattan decades ago after a particularly fatal crash, and serious crashes continue at an average rate of one per year, including one in 2009 that killed nine.The most unappreciated aspect of the helicopters' impact, though, is the noise.  They ruin the possibility for enjoyment of the waterfront for a several block radius around every pier that they use.  When you run or bike past the piers along the waterfront you have to stop your conversation, they're that loud.  And the combustion vapors they're giving off aren't pleasant either.It really would contribute to the greater safety and enjoyment of all if they fully got rid of these flights.

As the BE-4 gets closer to production, and the Raptor gets some flight tests under its belt, a clearer picture on the thrust to weight and dynamic range of throttling will become better understood.But the really awesome thing is three orbital class re-usable engines available from US vendors for the first time ever.

By applying differential thrust on different propellers it executes commands from operator to tilt and rotate. If the computer fails, operator, even with a direct control of the propellers, will not be able to maintain a stable flight.From aerodynamic standpoint planes are much easier to pilot (all but military, same story with computers for better maneuverability) since they are designed to be inherently stable. So if all power is lost and you still have control of aerodynamic surfaces, there is not problem to land a plane after planning for some tens or even hundreds of kilometers (depends on initial altitude).	nuccy	5.828575	1.9527935	comment	3.0	11.0	1604439153	5.6562333

Personally I’m hoping to see re-light and some sort of flip, with limited damage to ground support equipment. IMO a soft landing is too much to even hope for.The engine re-light is non-trivial because they will be fed from a separate header tank at the tip of the nosecone at that point.It would not be surprising if this didn’t actually happen tomorrow, there’s a million things which could lead to further delays.

25339428	TL;DR: Liquid-fuel rockets work by c	TL;DR: Liquid-fuel rockets work by combining a liquid fuel with oxygen. To get the fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber in huge quantities, they use a big fancy pump. To power this big fancy pump, all liquid-fuel rockets burn fuel in a separate combustion chamber, using the hot gas to power the pump. After the gas powers the pump, it has to go somewhere. Most rockets just dump the gas (these are called 'Gas-generator cycle' engines). This is nice and easy (ha), but it also means that the gas isn't going through the main combustion chamber, so it isn't propelling the rocket. The rockets on Starship re-use the gas that drives the pumps, pushing them into the combustion chamber and burning any unused fuel/oxygen to propel the rocket.	marcusverus	5.8519373	1.1655295	comment	3.0	12.0	1607385052	6.2212

At least with a drone you're very aware that it's there. If you want to change the laws about taking pictures in public places - fine (and good luck!) but again, singling out drones doesn't make much sense here.

Make it an Airbus 380 and it might be entertaining.The solution is to raise the height for normal aircraft. That makes room for drones.

While everybody sees the risk of loosing prototypes during testing as almost likely, and non-desastrous as long as there is no loss of life (which was far more accepted until, say, the 60s), nobody would call a failed flight test resulting in a complete hull loss a sucess. The testing until failure happens on component and system level before anything flies the first time.Maybe actual space rockets arw different, after all those used to be expandable anyway, but still launch failures, and failing to get out of the atmosphere is a failure, shouldn't be seen as sucess of any kind.As a co worker of mine once out it: Everything flies if you apply enough thrust to it.

You want to be close to the equator, and on an east coast so you can launch rockets over the water and avoid dropping boosters on people. Rockets generally are launched to the east to take advantage of Earth's rotation (we're all moving about 1,000 mph to the east, so launching west requires about 2,000mph extra Delta v). SpaceX is a USA company, and I believe their rocket technology is considered a government secret and must stay in the USA. So that's why SpaceX themselves aren't putting launch pads in Mexico.Also I believe equatorial orbits are still possible to achieve from USA launch sites, it just means more fuel/ reduced payload.Interestingly, the James Webb telescope was launched from French Guiana, which is almost	the_mungler	5.9218893	1.2440525	comment	3.0	17.0	1682152979	6.0380697

Pretending that the wing is a solid object, very quickly the tips will be moving faster than the speed of sound.  At such speeds void/shockwaves start to form, radically changing everything.  The root of the wing is barely moving, the tips are supersonic, and somewhere along the middle is a transition zone that moves back and forth depending on speed.  Good luck designing that airfoil.  (This is what makes the TU-95 Bear so loud.  Its propeller tips are supersonic while the rest of the aircraft isn't.)There is a Russian saying about helicopters: You can place every problem in all aerodynamics on the tip of a rotor blade.	sandworm101	5.7974105	1.9587508	comment	3.0	14.0	1634965560	5.911642

Plenty of pics on reddit where people have built self-powered deployments, solar charges a battery inside, 4g for internet access, and mine away helium all day long. Was very profitable 14-24 months ago but HNT crypto price has plummeted and helium founders pretty much bet the same type of deployment could happen for 5g deployments which has pretty much been a disaster. 5g implementations require more $$$ equipment and pricey antennas, and a complex setup with a limited range.The appeal of these helium miners was a very simple setup and low cost.

I've seen one helicopter in the last ~10 years.  The helicopter had an accompanying tank truck on a gravel road.  The helicopter would land on top, refuel or refill the spray, then continue operating!  I was very surprised to see it operating like this.An airplane would have needed to fly 12 miles each way to the nearest airport.  Quick look online says they commonly fly at ~180 mph, meaning ~8 minutes wasted round trip.  I'm guessing the distance from the airport wasn't the major motivation behind the helicopter, but rather nearby power lines.	DavidPeiffer	5.832082	1.9571899	comment	3.0	12.0	1593666038	5.7889175

The point at which it does this depends on its altitude. Hypersonic vehicles attempt to make interception harder by reentering the atmosphere from space earlier than a traditional ICBM, and travelling at a lower altitude in their final phase.	gnode	5.7361574	1.3881623	comment	3.0	12.0	1558461066	6.4877205

So anything moving too fast (~8000m/s) simply cannot hit distant targets.  If fired horizontally, the shell will climb up as the earth curves away.  This causes all sorts of difficulties if trying to attack another ship.  At best, your shells will hit horizontally, far above the waterline.  You would need a shell that could either fly itself downwards, bleeding speed, limiting penetration, and defeating the point of using a railgun.	sandworm101	5.9680743	1.823248	comment	3.0	13.0	1561693546	5.777091

Poking holes in a balloon with bullets will cause it to gradually lose lifting gas, and inevitably come down. It may come down gently, so it can be salvaged and examined.In WW1, balloon busting was a big deal. Pilots found that riddling them with bullets didn't work that well, as the balloon could be reeled down, patched, refilled and sent back up again. But the lifting gas was hydrogen, so the pilots were then armed with tracer bullets, which set the balloons afire and they came down immediately, completely destroyed."

The quadcopter slowly ascends to the highest feasible altitude, bypassing all of the worst of the air resistance, and greatly reducing the delta v needed to get into orbit as a result.This was mainly helping with the atmospheric drag problem, though; you would presumably need a lot of atmosphere to get far enough from the planet to help with the increased need for horizontal speed with a super massive planet.Oh hey I found an old screenshot: https://imgur.io/zq8iyV0?r	sdenton4	5.8044744	1.9605992	comment	3.0	10.0	1694540064	6.131686

For fighting terrorists in flipflops, something like a super-tucano does its job for a tenth of the operating cost.Fundamentally, the A-10 was not built for CAS.

Not only is SpaceX able to put them up faster than Russia could shoot them down, attacking a Starlink satellite would be an act of war against the US regardless.I think SpaceX's concern is more related to domestic liability. The US's policy has been that they will not provide offensive aid for attacking into Russia. They've been very careful about the range of the systems they send for that reason.Unrestricted Starlink is not subject to those range limits. So, if the attacks which went deep into Russian territory involved Starlink mounted to drones, it would essentially be in violation of the US's own stated policy about military aid to Ukraine.

Apparently it wasn't too bad since the pilot managed the stunt twice without injury, but it's a possibility that would have had me crapping diamonds if I were asked to pull it off.	jandrese	5.8380585	1.935766	comment	3.0	14.0	1636914591	5.862549

That level of skill would be hard for a perfectly-programmed autopilot to do.With regards to Vietnam, a legend that I was told (but cannot confirm) was that Hueys had such bad tail rotor authority that they would take off straight up with the whole airframe spinning. Once high enough, the pilot would start the helicopter moving forward, which would allow the tail rotor to bite more, and the helicopter would stabilize.Crazy if true. And after seeing a stunt like that by a bona fide insane and top-tier veteran pilot, I believe the legend.	ghoward	5.9010744	1.9486818	comment	3.0	19.0	1636921889	5.5707407

The shape determines the smallest Mach angle that the entire plane fits inside, which gives a value for the maximum speed. The CIT limit gives a value for the maximum speed, which is roughly the same as the Mach angle value, at approximately Mach 3.3. To go faster, the plane would have to be skinnier, or the wing tips would poke beyond the Mach cone, and the entire tip would generate it's own set of shockwaves, which would most likely result in a sharp increase in temperature for the part outside the cone (which can be read as: the wing tips melt off).	chipsa	5.793875	1.9702691	comment	3.0	68.0	1684958017	5.8527985

A Trident-D5 missile is $30M, and can carry up to 14 (small) warheads (which would likely be a mix of larger warheads and penetration aids). Trident is still in production, but note that it's an economical US missile.
So given this very approximate math, ~$2M on offense could soak up ~$300M on defense. The cost comparison would look worse for the defense if you don't assume the (high) cost of a US offensive missile for parity."	sephamorr	5.984171	2.1975853	comment	3.0	13.0	1684970190	5.9688325

26231670	A simple physics-based plane model (	A simple physics-based plane model (like the one we made to understand vehicle-level impact of our technology development) dictates that the range-optimal cruise speed is proportional to 1/sqrt(air density), so it makes sense that the blackbird was more efficient at high speed when at high altitudes (admittedly, this simple model is subsonic, and there are a lot of other factors for supersonic flight).Since having lower air density also means you need a higher lift coefficient (angle of attack) to produce the required lift, and then you have more lift-induced drag (which goes with the square of the lift coefficient). I think air density more or less washes out when it comes to its impact on range.

Mini plane design.- GPS device is directly attached to the swappable battery unit to ensure it is always connected to a satellite, eliminating satellite connection delays when the drone powers up.- It is launched into a sky by a powered rail. It doesn't need to land to deliver the goods, the items get parachuted down. No infrastructure needed on the receiving end, the item just drops from the sky.- For landing the drone flies past an aircraft arresting wire while hooking onto it which decelerates it and causes it to swing down (suspended above the ground).

The reason I disagree with you now is because technology and methods of war-fighting have changed.Emerging defense technologies like drones, lasers, robots, micro-scale manufacturing, and self-driving vehicles - along with the latest generation of existing weaponry like MANPADS and anti-tank missiles - all preference the defender.  They allow a group of relatively untrained and loosely organized defenders who know the terrain well to deploy extremely effective resistance against an attacker, as long as it's at short range.  A drone swarm can quite literally destroy all hostile forces within an area without risking a single person, but it can't do this beyond say 100 miles out.

13993031	The engines have minor differences, 	The engines have minor differences, namely that the space shuttle used fully closed cycle engines while the falcon 9 does not.  All this means though is that the efficiency is slightly lower because some of the propellant is burned and the combustion product dumped overboard to power the turbo pumps that push the rest of the propellant into the main combustion chamber.  While this reduces efficiency, this makes the engine somewhat easier to design and I believe the next gen spacex engines will have this feature.The vertical landing design is actually really smart because it allows a relatively un-aerodynamic object to get back to the ground without adding heavy wings and fairings.  Rockets don't actually like having fins when they go up since the dynamic pressures get to be extremely high.	pdelbarba	5.8795795	1.2150497	comment	3.0	10.0	1490849865	6.018375
13993132	Winged stage will not have enough ki	Winged stage will not have enough kinetic energy at cutoff to allow it turn around and fly back to launch site, and landing it at the ocean takes building and operating a whole aircraft carrier - too expensive (and probably harder to safely automatically land than the way they do it now). So, that winged stage would have to redirect back to launch site the way SpaceX does it now - using fuel. And, it will have to always do it, not having the option of ASDS launch, severely cutting the payload on GTO and other high energy trajectory missions.For RTLS launches, it would do approximately as good as their current approach, the fuel for landing burn+legs will approximately weight as much as wings and wheels.

So, in the extreme case it would be _massively_ cheaper. On the order of 99% savings.At the moment, SpaceX is only reusing a portion of the rocket (the first stage, not the second stage or the fairings). And that re-used portion requires some refurbishment. SpaceX estimates it's 30% cheaper per launch right now.Over the next few years SpaceX will probably bring that cost down (though they won't necessarily pass that cost on to the consumer — they could very well just enjoy the extra margins). I'm guessing they can realistically get to 50-70% cost savings per launch over the next few years. though 	ncallaway	5.8333993	1.2144481	comment	3.0	21.0	1490917643	6.08882

The opening door creates an aerodynamic disturbance and the plane yaws or does something else and the aim is off. So that has to be corrected in the flight software - the plane must countersteer with the tail surfaces when the door is opened. And for some reason it's been very slow to create these rules.Now, let's assume the F-35 program is canceled.

They can't strike a target much faster than a ballistic missile launched from land or sea. And they would be much more expensive. Anything in orbit is out of reach of maintenance. It takes a lot of energy to get a satellite into a stable orbit, and then yet more energy to de-orbit a missile.	nradov	5.7940807	1.2434043	comment	3.0	23.0	1494209818	6.166116

Planes can then fire anti radiation missiles that home in on the radar emissions source. Also, most radars are limited by the horizon. Low level flying can let planes get close without detection.Now this doesn't mean destroying air defenses is easy. Factor in smaller SAM sites dispersed around th larger ones, as well as enemy air superiority fighter operating in the area and SEAD gets more complicated. SAM sites also sometimes turn their radars off until planes are close and ambush them.

They were not born from the same company nor process.It seems whatever generated the story was looking for some segue into how the price is down.The stock price was affected by the market's new knowledge. They both contain words for fire but are otherwise independent and distant events in Tesla's history.A more likely scenario is these liabilities that Tesla acquired a couple of years ago had otherwise gone unnoticed. They have now been noticed and the market will risk the outcome of Walmart and all of these other Solar City contracts.The potential risk of these contracts is what is weighing on Telsa's stock price, not a handful of vehicle fires.

The enemy has the choice to evade and lose their advantage, or go for the exchange in which case neither has the advantage.This means that in cases where you have the upper hand you can use better tactics that don't incur high cost to yourself, whereas where you don't you can turn a 0-1 exchange into a potential 1-1 or 1-0 exchange.

The method of operation of such a rangefinder is that you see two halves of a picture, and your job as the operator is to adjust a range knob until the two halves ""line up"" and produce a single picture. By making parts of the ship easy to mistake for other parts, dazzle made this hard.Dazzle fundamentally failed at this task because the primary opponent, Imperial Germany, did not use coincidence rangefinders. Instead, they used stereoscopic rangefinders, against which Dazzle had little effect. (Incidentally, the Germans also went to war with a naval camouflage paint scheme that was best designed to defeat their own instruments, and was notably less effective against the Royal Navy.)"

Structural strength is one thing but there are also aerodynamic limits.  The higher the G the higher the stall speed.  Superhuman or AI, trying to pull 10g in thin air will result in flow separation (ie stall) and departure from controlled flight... ie you lose control and drop like a rock.Missiles don't care about stalling.

Hoping to see some action there as that seems to be the new hotbed of SpaceX excitement. Not that I wish for a RUD but it’s far more likely to see something crazy on these early experiments making it more fun to watch.	bronco21016	5.8953934	1.1677806	comment	3.0	10.0	1599139019	6.017384

Airplanes are smaller, faster, and denser, so they have a lot more options.   Airships are big, slow, and light weight, that means hangers big enough to house them are rare and expensive and the wind has greater impact on them than an airplane.Case in point, in 2017 HAV (the airship manufacturer the article is talking about) had their prototype airship destroyed by strong wind while it was moored outside.

Yes an individual MANPAD is much cheaper than a chopper, but to defend your entire army from a few dozen choppers you’ll need to hand out a heck of a lot of MANPADS to get the coverage.The main saving grace of a system like this is that the munitions, unguided rockets and cannon rounds, are pretty cheap.

Only about 40 helicopters were lost to hostile fire in Iraq from 2004-2009. I'd say the flexibility is the main reason why you can't get rid of helicopters in modern armies.

Tesla wasn't the only company developing electric cars - Renault-Nissan Alliance achieved the sales milestone of 350,000 all-electric vehicles delivered globally in August 2016, ranking second was Tesla Motors with over 139,000 electric cars sold between 2008 and June 2016. It's also not clear that Musk founded Tesla, but I'm not clear on the history there.Tesla do have the strongest branding in electric cars though, and I would attribute that to Musk's ability as a showman.	verbify	6.338712	1.4278938	comment	4.0	19.0	1618217013	3.788591

I wouldn't be surprised if they take up a Crew Dragon with them in a cargo bay to bring the crew back down separately for the first manned flights, until they've demonstrated a strong track record of successful propulsive landings.As for Lunar Starship, it's massively overengineered for the Artemis requirements, capable of taking 100 tons to the Lunar surface. That's great for later missions to set up a base, but even then you'd likely need a crew version just for shuttling people back and forth.

They are by definition very efficient. That is a drone.On the other end of the spectrum The Spirit of Butts' Farm crossed the atlantic with 118 US fluid ounces (3.5 L) of fuel. It was flying for ~39 hour and 1,881.6 mi (3,028.1 km). That is about 2045 mile per gallon if I count it right. That is very efficient, and of course since the aircraft was unmanned it is a drone.	krisoft	5.800742	2.0216215	comment	4.0	15.0	1695198663	6.210394

The corrective actions address all credible causes and focus on changes which avoid the conditions that led to these credible causes. In the short term, this entails changing the COPV configuration to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded, as well as	hoorayimhelping	5.814629	1.2602065	comment	4.0	19.0	1483379867	5.900142

They aren't cheap.Naval engagements, not to mention aircraft engagements, happen at distances that are just not in the reach of cheap drones. Someone might get a surprise shot at an aircraft carrier in peacetime, but probably not while alert on the open sea.

You're not taking a suborbital flight, you're becoming an astronaut.As the initial novelty of ""being to space"" wears off, there will be demand (and money) to fund ever more unusual space experiences.At some point, it will become clear that there's not just one or two space travel companies, but a sp"	aazaa	5.9221816	1.1122667	comment	4.0	14.0	1626024000	6.261175

I was under the impression that New Shepard wasn't as serious as Falcon 1 (.e.g not capable of reaching orbit) and that SpaceX spent quite a number of years moving from pre-Falcon 1 to the regular launch successes of Falcon 9.Maybe someone who knows more about this can explain - are the technical challenges involved less associated with pure size and more to do with design/fabrication processes 	bimmer44	5.891877	1.1441706	comment	4.0	33.0	1473695765	6.1034565

There was also a simulator where the height of the helicopter was fixed and you could just tilt the main rotor forward or back to move and you could try this with or without a control system.The helicopter was completely uncontrollable without the control system.  In the simulator you'd just end up spinning around or something, but that was only because it held you at a fixed height for demonstration purposes.Seeing that demo made me realize how incredible it is that people have made helicopters work to begin with.  They really don't seem to be very cooperative without a lot of work in controlling them.	Natsu	5.8349786	1.9407964	comment	4.0	17.0	1629093012	5.856724

Early transonic aircraft would go supersonic in a dive, wouldn't have the control authority to get out of it, and would careen into the ground.They eventually figured out that the entire tail needs to be the control surface if they wanted it to remain effective beyond mach 1.I thought this would have been well known by the time the DC-8 flew, but perhaps not, because if it had been, nobody in their right mind would have attempted a stunt like this.	ohazi	5.693773	1.8452146	comment	4.0	17.0	1629611913	5.724872

If it needs payments for routing or whatever, just use an existing payment technology like lightning or something.It would be hard to sound more like a hype scam if they tried: “Powered by the Helium Blockchain, The People’s Network represents a paradigm shift for decentralized wireless infrastructure.”Edit: against my better judgment I read some of the technical stuff on their site.

I say re-learn, because they DID know how to do this correctly during the Gemini / Apollo eras (TONS of rockets blew up before they attempted human spaceflight).But culturally, something went deeply wrong, perhaps when we reached the Space Shuttle era, and they lost the willingness to ever accept failure or pushing limits -- the same process we tell tell children is critical to ever learning.	bpodgursky	5.8678536	1.1107411	comment	4.0	30.0	1583016901	-11.342341

Expressing these energies in eV per molecule, it’s ~0.26eV for HeH and ~ 4.5eV for H2. So H2 would seem to be stable at higher temperatures and should form first in a cooling gas mixture whose particle kinetic energies are declining.Or is “binding energy” different from “dissociation energy”?Would like to understand a little of the thermodynamics that allow HeH rather than H2 to be the primordial molecule.[1]  https://en.wikipedia.org/w	ridgeguy	5.316131	1.5128782	comment	4.0	15.0	1555612842	-11.55663

Superpower A would launch an ICBM, and then Superpower B would then laser it as it flies through the air or space. As the missile absorbs the laser heat, its surface starts to boil off, but if the laser doesn't boil off enough, then the laser counter-attack on the missile could still be survivable."

This is very unstable, so speed needs to be adjusted at kHz rates[3][4].* ""Electric rocket"": the thrust of the single propeller is steered using the control surfaces at the bottom to deflect the thrust. This is called thrust vectoring. Since the propeller is not directly used to steer, the speed doesn't have to be adjusted that often. However, the position of the control surfaces does.* Helicopter: tilts the rotor plane[5] to tilt the aircraft, and inclines the individual rotors to change the magnitude of thrust.

OF COURSE I would have set up TDoA equipment and had a company with anti-drone tech on speed dial (at the very least) if I were responsible for an airport bigger than a hobbyist field.I bet you could get cover for Gatwick with TDoA equipment for less than $10k easy, say another $10k to have it installed.Hell, you could probably get some amateur radio people to install it for free, but paying $10k is more CYA.Anyway, my point is that now they sure as hell will prepare, so next time (well... give it a year for them to get their thumbs out of their asses) it will not work as well.	knorker	5.7983665	2.015295	comment	4.0	16.0	1545576888	6.2903323

Rather than the best of both worlds they wound up with the worst problems of each.  A more interesting idea was the F-104 VTOL concept.  Rather than put helo blades on a fighter, take the delta wing of a fighter and spin it like a helicopter blade.  Take off with it spinning then fix it in place when flying forwards, potentially at supersonic speeds.  The concept was never built but would have avoided the inherent inefficiencies of Sikorsky's approach.  And a supersonic rotary-wing aircraft would be very cool.https://elpoderdelasgalaxias.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/f-104-...https://www.secretprojects.co.uk/threads/lockheed-f-104-%C2%...	sandworm101	5.829182	1.9714772	comment	4.0	14.0	1644437480	5.884983

Given the almost non-existent guidance system on the SCUD, their goal was simply to hit enemy territory and hope to get lucky. The Patriot didn't change that. But it did keep Israel from entering the war and kept the American public believing that the SCUDs were being derogated.

Being underwater and having to deal with additional drag also doesn't help. The large size of an aircraft carrier belies the fact that it is the fastest ship in the carrier group and can outrun all of its escorts. Larger ship = more space to pack powerful engines.That's also a major issue for a lot of other drone swarm schemes such as using drone swarms to counter fighter aircraft. Smaller drones don't have the propulsion to keep up with fighters, and once you make drones large enough to hold the engines that would let them keep up with a fighter you might as well build a fighter instead.	magicsmoke	5.8048477	2.0364573	comment	4.0	14.0	1586916413	6.2590046

There just isn't a comparison to what they're doing that justifies criticism that they're unsuccessful or doing it wrong. It's a different process.I'm not saying that Musk is perfect, or that you're doing this, but people like to fault this wildly ambitious projects for what they haven't achieved. But when they do work they have an outsized impact on the status quo. When Starship succeeds (and I believe it's just a matter of time whereas Tesla FSD is still an ""if"") it will revolutionize space travel in ways that seem sci-fi today.State-of-the-art today is building machines that cost billions of dollars and throw them away after using them one time!"	eagerpace	5.924659	1.1883665	comment	4.0	19.0	1698259004	5.9810047

With a helium shortage [1], I'm concerned about the long-term viability of an airship - so I ran some numbers to understand it better.Helium is used in medical applications for cooling magnets in MRIs - I found the quote ""An MRI unit requires approximately 2,000 liters of liquid helium to keep the magnet cool enough to operate."" [2] This is interesting to be because, in a helium shortage, healthcare applications probably get high priority.Liquid helium has an expansion ratio of 1:745 [3], so the 2000 liters of liquid helium for an MRI is the equivalent of ~1.5 million liters of helium gas.I can't find the exact volume of helium the Pathfinder 1 requires, but their website says ""Pathfinder 1 is 400 feet long and 66 feet wide"" [4], which modeled as a cylinder"	philip1209	5.30362	1.3276159	comment	4.0	12.0	1698261592	-11.729496

And while I'm quite optimistic that Starship will eventually be a success, I think it's healthy for people to take a step back and remember that Dragon was delayed for years (yes, so was Starliner but it's not relevant here), Falcon Heavy was delayed for years, and Starship is also delayed by years (and despite the other person's comment to my original, it's not the fault of the FAA). Falcon Heavy never actually achieved reuse/landing for the core stage, and has since abandoned even attempting it. I believe it was Shotwell herself who said Falcon Heavy was a mistake.

All of the replacement jets can fly over drop some munitions and they fly off. If you are lucky they did the job, but if they missed or the target survived you have to call them back. The A10 comes in, chews everything you pointed out to rubble, asked you if they got it and if not they are still there and adjust and do it again. In a long running firefight in mountains and canyons the ability to point the finger of god at any random outcropping as needed over and over as you move down the path is priceless.	myrandomcomment	5.812813	2.2130415	comment	4.0	23.0	1611765575	5.9899707

The only thing that matters when it comes to commercial providers is price. And SpaceX, (as far as I can tell) stands alone among the medium-heavy lift providers by providing a price directly on their website.Of course, for government launches the government typically wants extra services, which does boost the prices different levels for different missions (I think the Europa Clipper mission is particularly expensive for example). But all of those missions are competitively bid, and SpaceX tends to be the low price bidder, so those extra fees seem like they're probably pretty reasonable.	nordsieck	5.8385506	1.1685734	comment	4.0	30.0	1692307009	6.184728

After the end of the Cold War, the US reduced drastically its military expenditure. The danger was that some day will come (like, you know, the 2020's) when the US will need to restart the missile assembly lines. How do you keep enough people trained at an affordable cost? Well, you keep them busy building a rocket that never launches. Any single launch is money down the drain. You still need to launch, because if you don't you are in danger of fooling yourself: you think you maintained a qualified workforce, but actually they are all impostors. But other than quality assurance, the launches themselves are not important, they are just a cost. So you want to launch as few times as possible.	credit_guy	5.851066	1.1456965	comment	4.0	13.0	1694172032	-11.305318

If they slowly even out the atmosphere, they loose the speed. So they'll need to coordinate the door opening at exactly the right moment. And if it doesn't the whole instillation goes boom.I feel like it would be better just to use the money to buy more rocket fuel at this point. This is so much alike to ""game changing ideas"" like the hyperloop, solar roadways, and other ""disruptive"" tech that make a cool headline, but break down the second you think about the real world logistics and cost.I hope they prove me wrong if they can get it to work though, cheaper space flights could help the world in so many ways."	spicybright	5.9345164	1.1308049	comment	4.0	16.0	1606267948	6.1443143

Their battery / powertrain work has been consistently good before any of the huge capital efforts, and the path forward was pretty well defined.Same with their rocket engines.

ESC’s can be made with Arduino. I doubt they are flying DJI’s in one-way missions.

But it seems SpaceX is far enough that it is not possible to get close to the efficiency with an autophage rocket. It maybe was possible as long as first stage was always destined to crash, but when it can land safely the entire efficiency equation got turned on its head.Would that kind of rocket be usable for deep space (basically -- improve thrust to weight by eliminating the weight of the fuselage as you thrust)? I also don't think so. For space, much higher specific impulse engines exist than any kind of fuselage material that can burn itself.So I just don't see any use of this.	onetimeuse92304	5.8659453	1.1423047	comment	4.0	17.0	1705080232	5.8981643

32541294	The problem is drag and heating. The	The problem is drag and heating. The booster phase of a rocket moves slowest in the thickest part of the atmosphere so it mostly avoids this. Usually at the end of the booster phase a rocket is going 2-4 km/s but it's also at 60 km above sea level. (All these numbers vary somewhat by launch vehicle.) To travel at that speed even at jumbo jet heights, ~15km, would generate insane amounts of heat and drag; the front of the craft would be white-hot and there would be massive loss of energy to friction. And it would still need to have the fuel and engines to accelerate another 5 km/s to stay in orbit.It's physically possible but the engineering is insanely difficult, much more so than a traditional rocket, which is already no cakewalk.	ericbarrett	5.863064	1.1179465	comment	4.0	20.0	1661096818	6.064533

So for the cost of 2 SLS flights, SpaceX is developing a rocket with a cost to LEO orbit of under $10 million, and that they are aiming to get down to $2 million.Some of that sounds like unreasonable optimism.Given the track record of SpaceX, it's safe to assume that Starship will eventually fly and that the lower stage will eventually be reusable. Getting the Starship itself to survive reentry and landing in good enough condition to fly again without major refurbishment is another story. Something like that has never been achieved before.

Green lasers are made by running an IR laser through a crystal that doubles thier frequency, shifting IR into what we see as green light.  But go cheap on the crystal and a green laser pumps out invisible IR  possibly in a slightly different direction than the visible beam.  Your eyes dont even blink because they dont see the IR.  You dont notice the damage and simply think it a headache.See an eye doctor asap and tell them you were exposed to a high power green lasers.  They cannot fix things, but better you learn about any new blind spots before you drive a truck.	sandworm101	5.521866	1.2601954	comment	4.0	18.0	1699316258	6.970065

That's easy enough when the rocket is sitting on the ground and when the engines are firing, but once the rocket starts coasting/decelerating (e.g., when the engines turn off due to reaching the end of their burn) the fuel may drift away from the fuel intakes, resulting in the engines ingesting vapor/gas the next time the engines turn on. Rocket engines are designed with a pretty specific operating environment in mind, so ingesting vapor/gas instead of fuel usually leads to the engines expressing their displeasure in a very vocal fashion.This poses a challenge for staging.

Or just build a huge ramp.It sounds like a joke at first, but it might not be impossible. You just need some kind of reverse linear induction motor that doesn't require much weight on the plane side. Perhaps the fuselage is the magnet? If the takeoff acceleration is 2g, you need a 1 km ramp. The varying lift of the wings will be an obstacle, though this might be manageable with flaps.

These planes can provide much more than 10 seconds of weightlessness, do it a dozen of times per flight without exceeding 2g of acceleration. Much bigger volume, much bigger payload, people can use it, it looks better in every aspect. By comparison, the drop tower can do three 10-second experiments per day, and the acceleration/deceleration look quite violent.If you want to get in and have a trip, it costs around $5-10k. So judging by this price, it doesn't seem that the expense is high enough to justify building an apparatus that looks quite expensive.I'm sure that there is a very good reason for drop towers to exist, I just don't know which one.

You need the VTOL for most practical drone applications including delivery, but you need fixed-wing linear flight for range. It's better to use many small fans for the VTOL part for reliability and stability, and it's more trouble that it's worth to try and re-use the same thrust units for hover and for forward flight (the design points are completely different). The main clever thing that strikes me about this design is the twin boom, which minimizes drag in forward flight and is very frugal with support structure for the lift fans.On the other hand, this drone doesn't look production-ready to me. Too many exposed wires and servos. I don't rate its chances in a good downpour.	dTal	5.8056192	2.0156386	comment	4.0	13.0	1571446655	6.1367593

This is not going to be a car that you can bring for an inspection once per year, pay £30, change some oil, cabin air filter and be done. It's going to be as costly as any other air-worthy machine to own, in which case any kind of comparisons to a personal car are frankly out of the window, and anyone who thinks they"	gambiting	5.8298564	1.983614	comment	4.0	18.0	1572982914	5.7512455

As you pick up speed you no longer have to deal with that (after all, LEO has basically the same gravity and doesn't have to burn against gravity at all) but when you're launching off something other than a point mass, some of your thrust has to go towards ensuring you don't hit the planet, or you will not into space today.The practical designs we have for NTRs are solid core, which after long effort got up to a thrust to weight ratio of 7:1, meaning they could in principle car	ravi-delia	5.857107	1.0981404	comment	4.0	12.0	1706993330	5.868382

Purely from a governance standpoint, as a citizen I hate to see corporate interests trying and succeeding to usurp government and societal norms.Sometimes examples need to be made so others know not to make the same mistake.	bradchris	5.9668674	1.1818329	comment	4.0	13.0	1708104680	1.064063

The aircraft itself was a pioneer in fly-by-wire technologies, which Airbus (the current name of the consortium that build Concorde) later commercialized, also at an initial loss. In this way, the entire business was kickstarted by the governments of Britain and France.The net result was a company that now outsells Boeing, especially in light of the latter's quality issues. Even though Concorde never made money (and never really could make money w/ the supersonic restrictions it had), I think it was still a win for the companies and countries involved.	dtagames	5.6280694	1.9094961	comment	4.0	14.0	1709565478	5.8365116

A small rail network could transport the same small goods over the same areas with less energy and no potential dropped/damaged goods.Their aerial route should ideally not go over forested or ecologically sensitive areas, in part to avoid contamination from crashed drones, and in part because drones push birds out of their nesting and feeding grounds, and territorial birds actively fight small drones.	throwaway892238	5.7884355	2.028649	comment	4.0	38.0	1658371162	6.2986584

Boeing uses a NASA testing plan where hardware is verified on the ground through extensive part or subsystem-level testing. This method has a downside which is that many things end up needing a higher factor of safety than absolutely necessary due to uncertainty in the risk calculations.SpaceX uses a different testing strategy where a lot more stuff is tested as a complete system.

I am a casual observer but I believe specific impulse is most important - how much thrust do you get per unit of fuel. The amount of fuel you have to carry has a huge impact on how much. Of course things like ion thrusters have high ISP but not enough thrust for launch - but once you get enough thrust to launch a rocket, you want a high ISP. High ISP means way less fuel required which means even with less thrust you will be okay. So thrust per nozzle area isn't strictly that important if the engine is so inefficient you need to carry twice as much fuel.	TaylorAlexander	5.8554144	1.1562248	comment	4.0	14.0	1687550581	5.7030444

It is not 40 minutes, but considering that high speed trains typically go downtown to downtown and usually don't require you to show up more than a few minutes in advance, it is often the fastest way to go in practice. Hyperloop doesn't bring much to the table compared to high speed trains.- The individ	GuB-42	6.1092167	1.7021772	comment	4.0	25.0	1597272975	4.6660404

When Iran shot down a US drone, there was pretty much no real response by the US. If it was a manned plane, there would almost certainly be at least retaliatory strikes, so Iran (and other countries) are going to be much less likely to shoot down a manned F-18 than an unmanned one. So maybe having manned fighters is valuable just to increase the barrier to engagement.And regardless, is there even value in having autonomous fighter jets when we already have advanced missiles? It doesn't matter how good the pilot/AI is if they are just firing missiles from miles away. We already have missiles that can loiter for hours before choosing a target and attacking it (ex.

Lidar pulses are on the order of 10 nanoseconds, 100,000,000x less than a second.  The energy on your eyes is less than 100 billion times less than a second in bright sunlight.

29346935	Canada's fighter procurement saga is	Canada's fighter procurement saga is a fascinating tale of arbitrary and spiteful requirement definition. The initial pledge not to purchase the F-35 was basically a signalling of anti-Americanism, and a way to differentiate the Liberals from their Conservative predecessors, by saying the F-35 was 'the wrong airplane'. Then the Liberals got mad at Boeing over their dispute from Bombardier, so the F-18E/F were 'wrong' too.As far as I can tell, nobody has actually defined what they want to see or get out of a Canadian fighter, and there isn't a broad vision for the Canadian armed forces either.	nickff	5.8269453	2.251478	comment	4.0	48.0	1637892853	5.933514

This is Canada rejecting the oldest and cheapest plane of the three remaining.I think some people are commenting here by just stating what they want to be true, rather than looking at what's actually happening.Personally I'd rather the whole thing be scrubbed and they spend the $19b on something else.

This unit for example, to scan a mine network, would take constantly repositioning an operator to charge the unit as you make your way through the site, as the reach required will get longer and longer as you scan more of the site.What in others opinions is the fix for this? Is it a technology that doesn't exist or is it a technology we aren't allowed to use (tiny nuclear?)Of course it's always a design compromise, there are huge drones with 40min flight times, fast drones with 5min flight times, and much inbetween. But I guess I see the practical application of drones challenged by the flight time limitations.	ehnto	5.7896967	2.0245314	comment	4.0	14.0	1637985066	6.234507

But then the enemy adapts and starts only using tanks in ""solitary"", so to speak, or at most in ""pairs"". Does it make economic and operational sense to fly and risk a F-35 just to destroy two tanks? I don't know.The same goes for enemy artillery. Does it make economic sense to risk a F-35 sortie just to try and take out howitzers scattered over the entire front line?

Amazingly, these unmanned balloons originated from over 5,000 miles away in the Japanese home islands. After being launched, the specially designed hydrogen balloons would ascend to an altitude of 30,000 feet and ride the jet stream across the Pacific Ocean to the mainland United States. Their bombs were triggered to drop after the three-day journey was complete—hopefully over a city or wooded region that would catch fire."	irrational	5.6037517	1.6770012	comment	4.0	32.0	1676076571	8.241247

The PW2000 was designated by the USAF as the F117 engine. By labelling the F-117 aircraft with the same designation, they were able to hide the development in plain sight. If anyone heard or saw anything about the F-117, they'd assume it was related to the engine, rather than the secret stealth aircraft.I've never read anything on the internet regarding this theory, but it's an interesting theory nonetheless.	toomanybeersies	5.828355	2.1571193	comment	5.0	17.0	1532912152	5.961959

It wasn’t exactly normal sound so much as some kind of oscillating pressure wave.If diplomats are describing the sonic attack in terms of a buffeting car window then that raises the chance in my mind that these really were sonic or pressure attacks of some kind.

It becomes possible to launch bigger, heavier (that is, cheaper) stuff to space. Still high-tech stuff, for sure, but engineers will be able to make more tradeoffs, because there won't be a need to optimize everything to be small and light.	vvillena	5.8344774	1.1041698	comment	5.0	32.0	1699954660	6.267833

If SLS' mission criteria included an emphasis on reusability, NASA would have a fully reusable booster + core stage by now.This decision was entirely due to doctrine. STS was designed as a mostly reusable product and failed costs-wise, so the government basically forced NASA to go with something expendable instead. It is genuinely impressive that SpaceX proved that reusable launch vehicles can be made cost-effective, but it's nowhere near the kind of massive quantum leap that SpaceX's legion of hardcore followers seems to be convinced it i	kunai	5.8445954	1.1755615	comment	5.0	16.0	1668584606	6.0750027

Schmidle is not an engineer and I would have enjoyed a deeper dive into Virgin Galactic’s design choices, but it is a great book about (among other things) the tensions that emerge when a complex technical project is overseen from a distance by utterly nontechnical, PR-oriented upper management. The company’s communications and business strategies make a lot more sense knowing that the people calling the shots do not comprehend in the slightest how their product works.For many reasons (some alluded to in this article, many more in the book), SpaceShipTwo is an inherently risky experimental test craft—with death always waiting on each side of a narrow envelope—and it always will be.

28444885	Interesting choice by SpaceX to use 	Interesting choice by SpaceX to use their booster B1062.One would presume that, given the profile of this launch, they will definitely pick the booster that they have the absolute most confidence in. And so they didn't choose a brand-new-from-the-factory booster. They picked B1062, which has flown twice already.It's not a real champ like 1051 which has flown 10 times and may have picked up some age-related defects. But it's also not likely to have any serious build flaws, since it's survived launch twice already without any problems.I imagine this is the same reason they pushed NASA so hard to let them use re-flown boosters for their human launches. A decade ago, it would be an insane thought, but using previously-flown hardware reduces the risk.	mabbo	5.8674426	1.2042221	comment	5.0	25.0	1631022883	6.0776544

The Crew Capsule pitched around quite a lot after it left the booster. This would have been quite 'exciting' for any passengers but was easily survivable. SpaceX had a similar problem in their Dragon LES test a while back. Indeed, the BO Capsule looked much more stable under parachutes than the Dragon did.2. The commentators mentioned that the booster had flown and landed 5 times and would be retired to a museum. 5 times!? There was so little drama in the launch and landing that I expect they could probably launch it another 5 times with few problems.

The engines that they need don't exist and there doesn't seem to be an affordable way to create them.See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_OvertureIt is definitely cool from a tech point of view.	babesh	5.5983458	1.8933557	comment	5.0	38.0	1587161228	5.841479

23072412	The beauty of the Starship design is	The beauty of the Starship design is that if it works, it makes landing and taking off anywhere we want to go incredibly easy.  You don't need a special lander module, complex docking manouvers, to replace disposable heat-shields, or anything.  You land the Starship, and launch it again -- as is, no moving parts.Earth's atmosphere and gravity are much heavier and stronger than either the moon, Mars, or even Mercury.  If you have the regulatory controls to re-enter and land on earth safely, it's trivial to do it on any of those destinations.It's still an incredibly hard challenge, and not might not work.  But if SpaceX successfully reaches orbit and lands on earth with the Starship, landing on the moon and coming back is going to be an absolute cakewalk.	bpodgursky	5.844827	1.1293222	comment	5.0	25.0	1588621318	6.2070837

I suspect (or hope) we already have some decent options in the top secret space.Nothing we have now (publicly) is going to do a damn against a shipping container full of 2-5 lb drones each carrying 1 lb of C4 in a swarm with cheap off the shelf sensors going 100 mph nap of the earth in a distributed pattern. And that is currently entirely doable with off the shelf drones using existing software and published techniques for peanuts.

The American space shuttle performs that exact roll at that exact height because the orientation of pad 39A at Cape Canaveral is wrong and it corrects as soon as it clears the tower. The Buran launches from a different tower at a different latitude with a different height at a different orientation... but it performs _exactly_ the same roll.

Warm air rises, and cool air sinks, so with a big temperature difference between in-hole air and aboveground air, you get quite a bit of air movement.Thus, two things are happening. First, the warm air rising from the hole is less dense and gives less lift to helicopter rotors than the cooler air it had been flying through. Since the temperature change is extremely abrupt as the helicopter flies over the hole, the pilot may lose a bunch of altitude before managing to adjust the speed enough (read: increase the spin rate of the rotors) to compensate for the loss of lift.At the same time, the cool air pouring into that hole from all sides is go	georgecmu	5.8269043	1.92747	comment	5.0	18.0	1499785969	5.809392

Most of all climate technology, space tech and the internet has been developed off their back and productionized (ie most of the technology is de-risked thanks to the fundamental research from the government).This, frankly, unintelligent argument that the government is a waste of resources probably better represents your understanding of how difficult technolo"	boringg	5.9856606	1.1621388	comment	5.0	23.0	1637348679	5.9332695

And it has had well over 1000 launches and still holds the record (in the 70s and 80s) of the most number of launches per year for a single rocket type, which makes it a good target class for size of a reusable rocket.8 tons is about where Falcon 9 v1.0 started out, by the way.

And orbital assembly and modular launchers have followed in 1980s/90s, when the extreme optimization didn't matter so much anymore.It's interesting to see SpaceX taking the path of a custom-tailored launcher again, trying to integrate everything as tightly as possible (especially speaking of their direct Mars flight concept).

The SR-72 would cruise at Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound. It would do this at 80,000 feet, over twice the traditional cruising altitude of a 747. Even at this height, where the temperature is -60°F, friction would cause the fuselage to heat to 600°F. This would melt traditional aircraft, so the plane was built with titanium (ironically supplied by the Soviet Union).

I don't think the paper talked about it.You do need a good business model and a solid technical foundation. Hyperloop needs a lot of technical work still. Arguably this was also true of SpaceX in the early days, but Elon (and the team he assembled) could execute before running out of runway.I still think Hyperloop is worth working on, but it needs a lot of funding. The Boring Company will get to it eventually, because something like Hyperloop is required for the Mars colony.	diebeforei485	6.127262	1.6609249	comment	5.0	30.0	1703212786	4.6183686

16333443	There are two other reasons which Sp	There are two other reasons which SpaceX has mentioned before:- When you're landing a rocket, you need to be able to throttle down quite low.  Even a single Merlin 1-D engine, throttled down, is too much thrust to be able to hover with a nearly empty booster.  It's really hard to get stable combustion at very low throttle settings.  Having only one engine out of nine running for landing makes this much more manageable.- There are economies of scale and reliability when you're building large numbers of something.  Ariane 5 only launched 6 times in 2017.  It uses one first stage engine, so they're only building one engine every 2 months.  Falcon 9 launched 18 times in 2017, with 9 first stage engines per launch, that's roughly an engine every 2 days.

This tends to be more expensive because sensors have to be made out of exotic materials like indium-gallium arsenide rather than silicon. But it also has a big advantage: the fluid in the human eye is opaque to 1550nm light, so the light can't reach the retina at the back of the eye.

Make the paint/material all white to makes mosquito detection easier.And it'd be probabilistic: considering that, at some point, the mosquito is bound to fly at a height higher than 2 meters in your room.

He developed the tactic of moving his radar and missile launcher regularly, and then only turning on the radar for a short time and moving again.  He says that the F-117s going into Serbia were following the same flight path over and over and he figured out a good time and place to turn on the radar.In the book Skunk Works, there's some detail about the mission planning that goes on for F-117 missions.

ITAR restrictions, for example, prohibit foreigners from using or testing night vision equipment (even on US soil). If a team is hiring a rocket engineer, and it's a violation of ITAR for them to see technical data on SpaceX's rocket program then it's effectively impossible for a non-US person to perform in this role.

We decided that the US & NASA needed super-heavy lift capability.   Previous attempts to design a heavy lift vehicle were lost to political regime change and congress in-fighting.   Previous attempts to design a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle were cancelled due to its virtual impossibility.So NASA & Congress designed a program that was unkillable.   It greased too many wheels and lined too many pockets to make it easy to kill.   It was also designed ultra-conservatively using mostly existing designs so there was no technical risk.So now when we complain that it's a pork-filled boondoggle that's impossible to kill, that was the plan, and there was a	bryanlarsen	5.846509	1.1465508	comment	5.0	58.0	1605278240	-11.264504

So it rolls after clearing the launch tower to achieve the correct orientation.The Buran launch pad, by contrast, is able to rotate 360 degrees.

An airplane by its nature wants to fly and, if not interfered with too strongly by unusual events or by a deliberately incompetent pilot, it will fly. A helicopter does not want to fly. It is maintained in the air by a variety of forces and controls working in opposition to each other, and if there is any disturbance in the delicate balance, the helicopter stops flying, immediately and disastrously. There is no such thing as a gliding helicopter.This is why a helicopter pilot is so different a being from an airplane pilot, and why in general, airplane pilots are open, clear-eyed, buoyant extroverts, and helicopter pilots are brooders, introspective anticipators of trouble.

I could attach my iPod headphones to the laser pointer directly, then the photodiode to the speakers, and boom, music at about 100 yards, with almost no quality decrease, though I didn't do anything quantitative :)I've always wondered what places communication started getting hidden since we went online and no longer rely on things like numbers stations or drop boxes (though I assume dead drops still exist)	codezero	5.5264773	1.2143635	comment	6.0	32.0	1595875113	6.800607

Like they say, conventional bell-nozzle engines are optimized for a particular altitude, while aerospikes are not, and it's true that if you're going to use the same engine across a wide range of altitudes, aerospikes will be more efficient on average across that wide range than conventional engines will. At any particular altitude, though, a conventional engine optimized for that altitude will be more efficient than an aerospike -- they're ""jack of all trades, master of none"" engines.

Yet another benefit is that aircraft can fly to a more preferable point for the launch - for example, the point where it is convenient to drop the first stage of the rocket, or the point closer to the equator so the satellite won't need to spend as much fuel to change the orbital plane.

Most ABM systems today use hit-to-kill, which means that you actually have to make contact with the missile to kill it.  Physically hitting something that small and fast from a long distance away is hard even if you know exactly where it's going to be.  Terminal guidance needs to be very accurate, since in the last second the missiles are a mile apart.  With an update rate of about 10 hZ, you have to make your final correction that is accurate to about two feet (the diameter of the missile) over about 1/10th of a mile.  That's tough.Most other missile systems (like surface-to-air or air-to-air systems designed to kill planes) have proximity fuses, and don't need direct contact, they just blow up nearby and throw shrapnel into the plane.

A kilometer is a pretty normal miss rate for a ScudAssume a target of 0.1km x 0.1km, but the missile may hit anywhere in an area of 1km x 1km around the target. That means the area of the target is 1/100 the size of the overall area. They'd have to launch at least 50 Scuds to have even a 50/50 chance of hitting the target.Can someone tell me if that calculation is way off? It sounds like this attack, other than spreading fear and panic, was very unlikely to work.	stats300	6.0376472	2.2604265	comment	6.0	30.0	1512403301	5.959023

China might not like satellites flying over their territory but there's not much they can do about it legally. It's not part of their airspace. SpaceX doesn't need permission; just for operating radios on the ground that communicate with those satellites. Which of course a few countries won't be willing to do because they'd instead prefer to use their own satellites.Because SpaceX is of course hardly the only one with plans like this. Like it or not, there will likely be tens or hundreds of thousands satellites in orbit in a few decades. Millions even long term. They are too cheap and useful for that to not happen.

It does seem absurd that they wouldn't review the active warnings prior to launches. What is indisputable here is that they've announced the loss of 40 satellites during an active warning. I think it's valid to wonder what the criteria is for a launch, given that the cost of the launch + payloads is quite high, and the cost of delaying the launch is (relatively) low.

I’m absolutely certain that Elon musk isn’t the first person to come up with the idea of reusable rockets, and the people who actually did the work of designing those rockets were already around before Elon musk hired them.  Tom Mueller, who was the first rocket engineer Musk hired, was building rocket engines in his garage out of frustration that nobody was taking him seriously at work.  So the question is, how deep does institutional rot have to go to stifle innovation on this level industry wide?

30347743	Falcon 9 reuse means expendable Star	Falcon 9 reuse means expendable Starships probably will never be a thing (IMHO). Why? Economics. The Falcon 9 can get ~22t to LEO. Starship is planned for ~100t. If the net cost of a Falcon 9 launch (factoring in reuse) is $20m then that puts an effective cap of $100m on the cost of a Starship launch.You can still launch beyond that but it means you're doing so for non-economic reasons. This could be range (eg geosynchronous or Moon orbit instead of LEO) or larger payloads. Falcon Heavy launches seem to be pretty much exclusively military payloads to high orbits that the Falcon 9 just can't carry.People forget that payloads are deeply coupled to the launch system. Starship will ultimately allow a much larger payload (eg think of JWST 2.0 but with way less complexity) but that will take yea	jmyeet	5.833834	1.1621467	comment	6.0	24.0	1644939068	6.102764

SpaceX has been negotiating a lot of their commercial contracts in a vehicle agnostic fashion.Here's another way of putting that: SpaceX has designed it so F9 and Starship payloads will be interchangeable. That's not quite the same thing. You can't just take an F9 payload and bolt it on top of an Ariane rocket.> Starship is being designed with the intent that it will cannibalize all Falcon 9 launches eventually.Sure but that's just going to take a long time, particularly if F9 is, say, sub-$15m per launch. There's a lot that still has to be done for Starship (eg the landing system, the crew component).	jmyeet	5.827679	1.1491902	comment	6.0	24.0	1645143875	6.1742396

Worse still, many have leakage into other frequencies, making them even more difficult to block. On the flip side, a co2 tube is much simpler - some common and readily available plastics transparent to visible light are opaque to the IR wavelengths emitted by co2 tubes, dramatically simplifying blocking material selection.You should nev	542458	5.5169754	1.248602	comment	6.0	36.0	1706330020	6.759418

A heavy space plane has zero advantages over a capsule for most work done in LEO. It's good to see this renewed focus on more practical designs.(If that's incorrect and you're qualified to correct me please do.)Having said that, the name Starliner writes a check that a manned capsule won't ever be able to cash. This is the first time I've heard of Boeing's Starliner and it got me really, really excited until I pulled up a picture of it. They really should have picked a less grandiose name.	mbenjaminsmith	5.881187	1.1732218	comment	6.0	35.0	1485417226	6.21428

And any drone specifically used to spy on neighbors will either be relatively close and thus fairly loud and noticeable, or have nice camera gear that would already enable a lot of spying even without a drone (e.g. in upper story windows, again).The safety issue doesn't strike me as compelling. I don't think drones introduce much physical danger beyond, say, playing baseball in the neighborhood. Obviously if the sky became very crowded with delivery drones, or crash landings became at all common, this would be an obvious reason for heavy regulation, but I don't see this posing much of a danger.	tshaddox	5.799535	2.0190337	comment	6.0	34.0	1628118084	6.3794193

This is someone who wanted to let the US know that they are capable of getting a high-end drone into the country and launch it near important civilian and military infrastructure. Which is also why they would affix it with a bright LED light, they wanted to get noticed and then show off its capabilities.It might sound counter-intuitive to outright tell your enemy what you are capable of, but that's exactly how deterrence works. Winning a war is good, but it's better to convince your opponent that they shouldn't start a fight in the first place. Which means your opponent needs to have some understanding of what you are capable of.

We could have developed several specialized planes at a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time that it took for this one plane to come into production.While I don't doubt that it is better to fly than the F-16, so would every other plane we would have developed instead of this nightmare. I also am worried that it will be obsoleted with the development of advanced military drones.

Also, biofuels and synthetic fuels have their own environmental impact (land use).Supersonic planes are incredibly cool, but I can't help the feeling that it's an unnecessary and harmful luxury at this point.

Heavily armored, with enormous guns, military planners expected that the battle for the Atlantic and Pacific would be carried out by these monsters slugging it out. Though there were hints that planes could be quite effective against ships, few admirals realized that the longer range of an aircraft carrier would make the battleships effectively obsolete in ship-ship battles. And after all, they'd spent a ton of money producing those battleships, and developing doctrine.

Yet at the same time he talked about a million tons on the surface of Mars, which means 5 million tons on the LEO, which means 50000 launches - still some 15 times more than that.

A B-2 bomber is large enough to absorb useful radar frequencies, but F-35 or F-22 isn't.What the F-35/F-22 stealth does get, however, is invisibility in the XHF and higher frequency ranges, which is what is used for radar guided missiles.  So they will have a major advantage against ground and air launched long range missiles.The F-22 also has good infrared suppression, which protects it against infrared guided missiles.

For many drones, the expectation for failure dramatically increases just after 100-200 hours of operation[1]. Figuring out points of failures, building systematic fault trees and increasing MTBF by order of magnitude or two would be big part of the drone delivery projects.[1] https://catsr.vse.gmu.edu/SYST490/490_2014_SPDAV/DST-NSPDAV_...	sytelus	5.8022766	2.0066383	comment	6.0	92.0	1565053347	6.1716876

Missiles are expensive and relatively slow; a laser weapon could potentially shoot down missiles and aircraft so fast as to be a game-changer.There's been a lot of noise about whether aircraft carriers and other capital ships are viable at all in the face of high-speed anti-ship missiles. Intercepting them with CIWS and counter-missiles is dicey, but a good laser system could make anti-ship missiles useless.On the other hand, you have to wonder if operating aircraft at all might become non-viable if your enemy has weapons like that. Speed might become much less important and stealth much more important.	ufmace	5.590703	1.3742058	comment	6.0	36.0	1489767490	6.4380875

Instead of trying to hold one big antenna up with huge cables, you use an array of antennas flying above the dish on drones. This allows for low cost, easy beam steering (within the limits of the shape of the dish), adaptation for different frequencies, quick stowing when weather arrives, etc. Even station-keeping to the required accuracy doesn't seem that hard (you might have to do some active phase correction).

Without government, SpaceX would literally not exist.So in my mind they're as ""private"" as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, or Boeing; meaning sure, the government doesn't own the company shares, but they are de-facto extensions of the US government and would die if the government wanted them to cease to exist.The truly amazing things for me with SpaceX are: Elon Musk is somehow allowed to have a role despite ties to China and a behavioural history that would make anyone else ineligible, and the fact that they are intentionally staying privately-owned in order to keep financials out of the public realm."	tenpies	5.9383755	1.1712805	comment	6.0	23.0	1605494718	6.158205

There might also be rule of engagement restriction, as has been many times that forced within-visual-range.For WVR, the ability to supermaneuver is useful. It can give you that extra edge to get the angle on a target. You have to give up a lot of energy, sure. But you do have >1 TWR, and your buddies to cover you. It's not a magical tool but another one in a toolbox.Also, in WVR, the advantage goes to the side with fewer planes. There was a study from the korean war to show this.

The next year should be pretty exciting as they develop things further. Starship has a number of big innovations, which are:- the raptor engine. This was developed behind closed doors and is sort of finished. We won't see much of it, but it is the most advanced rocket engine ever made and I'm not aware of any upcoming engine that can compete with it.- Stainless steel construction. What we're seeing with SN5 is the basic tank structure of the second stage.

The costs to go to orbit and beyond using this engine could be less than half that of current best in class technology; even less after development cost amortization. Not sure why SpaceX haven't invested in it yet.

If you can shoot down anything, but you only have 40 shots, obviously you can be defeated by anyone who can make 41 of even the crudest missiles. Likewise the best tank in the world is much less effective after it runs out of ammo. But if the issue is merely scale, all you need to do is make more interceptors, which is a finite and predictable expense, as opposed to developing a new technology which could be a massive money pit that ultimately fails.The US maintains a rather small inventory of interceptors because for the past few decades only small strikes by rogue nations or accidental launches by major powers have been considered likely threats, and a large number of in	jjk166	6.005315	2.2045393	comment	7.0	70.0	1684964810	5.96614

Car chases in LA are often eliminated when there's a police helicopter because they can simply follow the vehicle safely from a distance as the chopper tracks the car.Providing overhead visibility support in advance of police arrival is a huge benefit to citizens during 911 calls. If a drone can respond in two minutes, and police are 7-10 minutes away, that's a massive situational awareness benefit that will save lives.When someone calls for a house fire, having a drone arrive in minutes, potentially with a fire retar	davidu	5.8049874	2.0249915	comment	7.0	57.0	1686060871	6.410782

Once Prometheus has flight models the Raptor will be at least a decade ahead, probably continuing to move rapidly.

I think that would be a lot cheaper and harder to build defences for than an EMP.(Just realised that you could also spray a opaque gas which would also block vision and might make less of a mess to clean up).	robkop	5.8055015	2.0350285	comment	7.0	46.0	1518139273	6.3584275

On the other hand, by not helping the military become more efficient we also risk losing existing lives (our own and civilian casualties) due to a lack of efficient analysis.

Regulations ensued, and that effectively stunted any efforts to minimise the sonic boom in commercial applications.I'm hopeful this can kickstart a new effort to renew SST and scale it to where it was more cost effective than the Concorde tried to be.	ashleyn	5.6702046	1.8894341	comment	7.0	34.0	1523366536	5.982456

That is not the same as “running out” however, and we’re not running out of it.Maybe someday the media can honestly reflect reality in this case with a headline that talks about being less wasteful of a valuable resource so that it doesn’t become painfully expensive, rather than framing in terms of actual scarcity on Earth.

If you shrink an aircraft down, the aerodynamic cross-section (i.e the drag force) scales with the area (scale^2), but your engine thrust is going to drop roughly by the decrease in volume (scale^3).So you end up losing maximum airspeed and fuel efficiency (in terms of the mass you're moving) the smaller you go. Unless the drones in your swarm were really big, it doesn't work out.Although, I imagine we'll see some smaller, unmanned jet fighters in the future (assuming someone figures out how to control something like that remotely, or autonomously).

SpaceX has quite effectively shown that you can out compete bigger players with a combination of modest availability of capital, talent and out of the box thinking. The level of their capital expenses is quite a lot more reasonable than what it took Nasa to get to the Moon or running the space shuttle program.

27315350	Two problems with drones, their rang	Two problems with drones, their range isn't enough and they would need to navigate visually towards the boat because all radio including GPS would be jammed if you tried this.For the range, I think the typical outer perimeter of a carrier group is 100 to 200 nautical miles as patrolled by the air wing. Then at 20 nautical miles you would run into ships, and that's still too far away to launch a big swarm of ultra cheap drones because they wouldn't make it to the carrier.	t0mas88	5.8025584	2.0295837	comment	7.0	52.0	1622210144	6.3312025

To remind you, lethal devices that kill people autonomously without operator's direct control have long existed. They have killed probably millions of people and keep killing every day. They are called landmines. Landmines are not as cool as flying drones for sure, but they are way more dangerous because they are dirt cheap, produced en masse, and widely available to unsophisticated combatants. If you're terrified by autonomous drones, maybe you should be even more terrified by landmines despite they are not as intellectually stimulating as drones.	dgudkov	5.858501	2.0625026	comment	7.0	36.0	1622451651	6.2388453

Targeted drone strikes, in terms of the ratio of unintended death to intended death are honestly better for everyone involved (except the target :P).

This is basically using the RF emissions of the plane, and their detection at multiple RF detection stations with synchronized clocks, to determine the difference in arrival time. The radio emissions all travel at the same speed through the air, the difference in arrival time can be used with some simple trig to figure out where the RF emitter is. There are a number of Time Difference of Arrival or TDOA systems out there. It is why I expect aircraft stop using their radios when they are about to engage their targets.That said, they are ""easy"" to jam in the sense that when you have two radio signals on the same frequency, they will interfere with direction finding.

I see this mentioned now and then with disappointment that the one thing close to a rocket - the Concorde - was discontinued.But what happened in the aerospace industry is that we instead focused on fuel efficiency and lower noise, which lead to the high bypass turbofan engine.Instead of accelerating a small amount of air to supersonic speeds, which is both extremely noisy and fuel inefficient, we moved to a system that takes that small amount of air and uses it to drive a much larger fan which then takes a large volume of air and accelerates it to subsonic speeds. That's why 'jet engines' of the old days were much thinner and noisier than the really fat engines we have today.This led to much cheaper and quieter air trave	mmaunder	5.657365	1.8879681	comment	7.0	48.0	1585247974	5.8261642

(i.e. any excess lifting force comes from the fact that the mass of the hydrogen or whatever is less than the mass of the displaced air)A vacuum (or near vacuum) would provide more lifting force per liter, would not have the scarcity problem of helium nor the safety problem of hydrogen, and assuming the thing that generates the vacuum is transportable, it'd eliminate the need for separate ballast.Edit: the wikipedia article cited by slibhb has all sorts of good info - thank you for sharing that!	dbrueck	5.43416	1.6919515	comment	7.0	38.0	1675114623	-11.55666

Cool and all, but that is not a test flight.Initially I thought it was using those spinning-cylinder wings to produce the VTOL behavior! Decent approach, though.No sound. I'd like to hear how noisy it is: the wind alone will be pretty loud, even if the electric motors are silent. And again, there's nobody in that: with a passenger it's going to work maybe three times as hard, depending on how light and dronelike it is empty. They might have next to no batteries in there, it behaves like it's quite staggeringly light.Clever to use dronelike autostabilization to avoid having much in the way of control surfaces. This vehicle absolutely depends on having those fans working, and probably couldn't glide to a landing of any sort.	Applejinx	5.802925	2.013265	comment	7.0	27.0	1492810348	6.2209754

The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position where it wasn't, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn't, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn't.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZe5J8SVCYQ	btown	5.99875	2.1030428	comment	7.0	26.0	1691708123	6.104909

It just doesn’t make sense.Admittedly, drones with IEDs can be used as a terror device, to kill someone in a group of people, but as a targeted means of killing I can’t imagine it being better than a mortar or RPG.

Normally the creation of a new division of the military has stemmed from a new domain that is being controlled by the command structure of another domain which is impeding their mission.The Air Force had complete control over the domain of space, splitting space out didn't answer any real organizational problems.IMO, the real forward looking decision would be to have created a cyber force.  Apparently US Cyber Command is a shit show from having several seperate command hierarchies.  And arguably the material conditions of the cyber domain are a greater present threat to the enforceable boundaries of the US.	monocasa	5.99728	1.125624	comment	8.0	29.0	1657164093	6.2176733

They were selected over Sierra Nevada who had a 3.6 billion $ proposal using the Dreamchaser aircraft.Some news emerged that Boeing believed that SpaceX could not deliver anyway and if they both didn't deliver the could renegotiate with NASA and demand more money. Unfortunately for them, SpaceX delivered without asking for more money.Since then Boeing has failed its first test flight and has run into major issues with the second one, and it will not launch for many more months.

The trillion dollar figure includes acquisition costs (going to 2070) as well as operations and maintenance over the same period.By the way, the F-35 isn't any more expensive than other aircraft. For example for the latest budget proposal (2022), the DoD plans to acquire 85 F-35s [1] for a total price of $85 BN, or about $150 MM per plane. At the same time, it plans to acquire 14 tanker aircraft KC-46 for a unit price of about $180 MM, and 9 cargo helicopters CH-53K for a unit price of $190 MM. Yes, you read that right, those are helicopters, they are not attack, but cargo helicopters, and cost almost $200 MM apiece.[1] https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/263871...	credit_guy	5.796921	2.2149844	comment	8.0	100.0	1637765760	5.964166

The air frame couldn't handle a takeoff with a full fuel tank, so it had to be filled up right after taking off. 90% of the parts manufactured didn't work. It was difficult to maintain and eventually developed a ""speedy"" one-week turn-around time to get it to fly again after a mission, assuming a base had the specialized tools and support staff to do so.The SR-71 is an example of how the sheer will to get something done can indeed accomplish great feats, if at great cost and complexity.

Its purpose is providing independent access to space for ESA member nations at a reasonable price, and as insurance against a launch monopoly (it upper-bounds what others can charge ESA). Ariane 5 is also extremely reliable, which is very important for some launches (NASA's James Webb telescope is going to launch on Ariane 5, for example). Ariane's goal is not to win the most commercial contracts or compete with SpaceX on price.This is also the reason reusability doesn't make sense for Ariane. With less than ten launches per year, fixed costs make up a large portion of the cost. If they only needed one rocket per year, it wouldn't really get all that much cheaper because they still need the factory.	lorenzhs	5.826737	1.1536303	comment	8.0	28.0	1533571609	6.1302924

Subsonic ammo is simply not workable at these ranges; that's called 'artillery' and it doesn't have sufficient precision to ensure hitting the rocket.You can listen to the explosion here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6isMuPfxcII hear birds chirping.

Tesla paid back their loans while other car manufacturers didn't.SpaceX was not the first in the launch business - they were in fact the only one who attempted to break into a monopolized market that no one dared to touch. It's remarkable that they not only fight their way in, but also did it so well that they became the largest launch provider in the country, and in some cases the only one in the United States - SpaceX saved the tax payers a ton of money by reducing launch costs.You don't have to either hate or love a guy - Elon fucked up m"	alsodumb	6.1241217	1.3005052	comment	8.0	52.0	1668742826	4.026809

Moreover, they're small enough that they wouldn't represent a substantial threat to a ship in and of themselves (as compared to, say, an explosive-laden dinghy), and so perhaps not necessarily the kind of target that would've been specified for these weapons systems.

But certainly does negate many of the aspect people have against armed drones as this is in effect a human drone.But it is pretty neat, as many recall the facination with jetpacks and the dreams that we would all have them in the 60's/70's (along with flying cars), so this kinda ticks many box's of past dreams.As for distance/flight time - kerosene is pretty dense energy wise, and I can't think of anything else that would be as flexible and offer greater energy density.

That rocket was first used about a year ago.Factors that might prevent this from making this economically superior to 'just' ramping up production are:- the fraction of launches that can be reused.- the amount of effort needed to prepare a rocket for reuse relative to that needed to produce a new rocket.They will have been extra cautious this time, but from the above, the answers _could_ be ""about 10%"" and ""almost one year, taking way more effort than building a new one does"".I would think the real answers are a bit better"	Someone	5.8453975	1.1782796	comment	9.0	29.0	1490915423	6.1013107

Buying a plane, like the SAAB JAS 39 Gripen, would have allowed the Danish Airforce to do basically the same operations, for much much less money. The Danish airforce isn't going to intercept Russian fighters. The missions are patrol and bombings for NATO.For a country like the US, sure, maybe the F-35 is something they need for the type of missions they fly. I just can see any country do anything with 27 planes. 27 is less planes than an aircraft carrier has.	mrweasel	5.7980447	2.2495525	comment	9.0	35.0	1553781059	5.991939

The helicopter dies from a single stray rocket, random spam and attacks from behind. Alt+arrow for strafe worked in DooM because field of view always pointed away from the player. Here, strafing is hard to get used to.
Since there are already 2 keys for ability, why not make one of them ""strafe left"" and the other ""strafe right"" ?
Also, because helicopter lacks a clear point, it's harder to aim.Stealthy Prowler is very slow and not especially fun to play. To the point that only effective way to play is to cloak after every rocket fired. You crawl towards a victim, then shoot at close range, then recloak.

It probably can go at least 10 times as far by boosting the gain of the amplifier, it is not constrained like a theremin would be because it is already working in the far field region of the antenna.Because it work at such high frequency (but not so high that it can still go through walls), it has many very small antennas arrays, and sense sub millimeter movements even from far away.

And when it flys same speed as plane, in ""projected"" large distance those speeds are enormous. And their agility is amplified in the same way.The result is that pilots see ""planes"" doing impossible manoeuvres at impossible speeds."	dvh	5.811535	1.9563106	comment	9.0	64.0	1646683529	6.3966613

From some of the available photos there's two wings, each with eight panels.There's a tradeoff between the weight of the solar panels vs simply using batteries (though batteries don't like the cold, and solar panels do), so I think maybe they were hoping the thing would stay aloft for a long time?My guess is that the actual package of equipment - batteries and sensors - is quite small. Maybe a telescope and gyro stabilizer or gimbal was part of the setup. Insulation probably bulked it up quite a bit; it's very, very cold at that altitude.I'd be curious what sort of uplink they were using, assuming the thing was actually fully fu	KennyBlanken	6.0850306	1.2965287	comment	9.0	82.0	1675558859	6.4859996

It seems more than a little absurd to argue that SpaceX - unlike literally every other defense contractor - should both be footing most of the bill for the service and should have no say over how the service is then used.Then, adding on to that, there's a huge difference in terms of regulations between a US company essentially supplying long range guidance systems (and ongoing services which enable those systems) of its own voli	dotnet00	5.749347	1.2102152	comment	9.0	128.0	1678649691	6.172562

The reserve was established with the enactment of the Helium Act of 1925.

Vacuum has few practical upsides and a lot of downsides such as safety, reliability, and cost.

Still higher stakes than doing nothing, but less so than shooting down a manned platform.For instance, when I was on deployment near the Gulf on a carrier, we would regularly have an Iranian P-3 fly very close to us even after repeated warnings.  Same thing with Russian Bears.  We'd usually sent up an F/A-18 or two to ""escort"" the visitor and would never think of shooting them down unless fired upon.  Yet, if a drone gets within 1000 yards, down"	bkohlmann	5.84692	2.0670543	comment	10.0	51.0	1563550186	6.3166785

Shareholders definitely have a great chance to sue Musk because he did not do this in the best interest of his shareholders, it's in the best interest of his cousin. Co-mingling all parts of his companies (SpaceX buying SolarCity Bonds) is a huge red flag that reeks of corporate malfeasance. He should have let SolarCity die, it would have come back as a stronger company once the initial investors were wiped out.	docker_up	6.342484	1.4981828	comment	10.0	49.0	1566834743	3.9920824

I've owned it over a year, but since new regulations came in I've been afraid to use it in case it was done incorrectly. What I've learned so far is that in order to legally fly my drone, I must:1. Register the drone online for $5 (done, took 2 minutes).2. Take an exam. They won't tell me what's going to be on the exam, but instead recommend I go to one of a long list of ""drone schools"" who have 'self declared' that they can teach what will be on the exam. The exam is $10, but who knows what these schools will charge or if they're even reputable.3. Not be within 5 miles of most airports, or 1-3 miles from most helipads.

This is a very rapidly evolving area of warfare.Right now we're using drones like we used early WW1 aircraft. As spotters for long range weapons and very occasionally as direct bombers. We haven't yet developed drones that shoot down other drones cheaply. So we can spot enemy formations, ships, tanks etc. without any cost effective way to stop the small spotter drones.I see this changing soon. We will soon have small cheap drones that will take down nearby spotter drones and the balance will change yet again.So don't throw away old tactics and equipment just yet. There's a gap where we have no reasonable way to stop drones that will soon be addressed.	AnotherGoodName	5.9029617	2.099971	comment	10.0	159.0	1653317596	6.2175417

This isn't anywhere close to the finished vehicle and several key technological problems remain. Yet, they've explicitly shaped it like the final version, and hyped it.In certain ways, 	areoform	5.8895774	1.1583327	comment	10.0	43.0	1607565826	6.076753

It's a company, and companies are top down. If these employees are at Musk's company, then they had better be prepared to play by Musk's rules, and they did the exact opposite, essentially leading a mutiny against the boss and sowing discord within the company in the process. SpaceX isn't an activist organization and has no obligation to kowtow to the demands of internal activists. Not all companies are like this, but again, you should know what you're signing up for when you join a Musk company.And I'd also be willing to bet cash that all these employees were very low level, likely new hires out of college, and are all of the political activist type.

NASA caught on (with help from CIA) and implanted falsified heat tile formulas, which the Soviets copied. Their first Buran only flew once and mostly burned up on reentry due to the bad heat tiles. The Soviets copied most of the design but used their own engine.[1] Then the USSR collapsed. Currently they are sitting in decaying hangars in Baikonur, just rotting away. There's video on youtube of people sneaking in (it's a guarded base), flying drones around them and climbing around in and out of them. It's pretty cool.

Later, after the agency had compiled data from shuttle flights, it went back and came up with a very different number. The chance of death was actually 1 in 12.The fact is, these numbers are made up because the systems are too complicated to calculate based on individual components. Until they have something like 50+ launches (after the kinks are worked out), we wont really know the actual chances of blowing up a rocket are. Further, how well do the escape capsule(s) work?

Basically, air travel is terrible for global warming.  Besides emissions of greenhouse gasses CO2 and NOx, the trails of water vapor (""contrails"") form cirrus clouds that contribute to warming.Unlike the electric car, there is no emerging technology that can save air travel from this environmental impact.  Meanwhile, air travel is growing at ~5%/year.  At this rate, by mid-century air travel alone will consume the world's entire emissions allowance, if we want to keep global warming to 2 °C or less.

The chance of any sort of aerial dogfighting happening in a war are next to zero. The cost of planes, and pilots, is so high that almost all the effort spent these days is on killing your enemy with over-the-horizon weapons fired from hundreds of miles away. AI-powered dogfighting in aircraft is military marketing.A nation could develop world-class AI planes and they'd be absolutely useless against a hypersonic missile fired from mainland China or a Russian submarine, nor would they be any use against a guerilla army in Afghanistan or Iraq that doesn't have the capability to fight in the air or that has 30 year old planes that can be shot down with 50 year old tech.

(Assuming the counter intelligence and reconnaissance determined there was a silo present.)I'd also worry (not much, but just enough to be creeped out and never want to buy one of these) that there may be some system that is still programmed with old silos as targets. If things heat up again, or if there is some error, that property might be a target.	echelon	6.0265164	2.2377756	comment	10.0	46.0	1643605022	5.9102464

Focusing that much light on a small moving object, through layered and moving air, with an intensity to burn through metal would be an achievement.  Burning through enough of that metal to degrade a falling rocket (as opposed to during boost phase of flight) is even harder.  For all the talk about cost reduction, have a look at what realworld laser armor costs.  Painting the nosecone of a rocket white, or coating it with reflective foil costs next to nothing but is remarkably effective.Better question: What would this do to a manned aircraft?  There is a reason there are treaties against blinding weapons.	sandworm101	5.5379014	1.2591572	comment	10.0	71.0	1643748624	6.715378

This drone does not fit the description of any known DOD drone, so you should assume it’s classified. The DOD is meticulous about only flying classified aircraft in restricted airspace where they can prevent prying eyes and inadvertent attention. Tucson is not immediately close to any of the usual hotspots for classified aircraft (Area 51 for example).2. The article describes the drone buzzing the original CBP chopper as well as flying an orbit around the police helicopter. It is reasonable to suggest that a collision between the drone and either of those helicopters would be fatal for the pilot. No military pilot I know would ever create the type of risky scenario as described here.3. 	ianhawes	5.7846265	1.9879625	comment	10.0	48.0	1624504505	6.3527975

Networked versions of this are much harder for stealth aircraft to hide from entirely however they have the radar signature of small birds. The S400 and upcoming S500 from Russia is an excellent version of this, but is itself vulnerable to electronic warfare countermeasures. Turning the sensitivity down low enough to detect small birds makes it impossible to use the radars from a practical sense.The second type of radar has an extremely narrow beam and is for targeting. This is the radar that locks onto a plane to direct missiles at it to shoot it down. This is the one that stealth aircraft pretty much entirely defeat.

Also as ub terrorism, the targets are ""soft"" and therefore difficult to defend.It looks like there's something new here that could serve as a model in other conflicts.

Because humans don't have to be inside of them they can also go a higher speeds, maneuver faster without human body limitations4. If a drone goes down, the drone pilot can man another one. All that training and knowledge is retained. Human operated vehicles have a high probability of losing their occupants.5. If 5,000 drones get destroyed, it's lost money.

A falcon 9 is probably a bit more expensive - Soyuz rockets are extremely cheap despite not being reusable.  If the launches are dedicated solely to Starlink and not sharing significant payload space, that is about $200 million in expenses for the year.Assuming a 5 year working life before the satellites de-orbit, the satellites launched this year have $40 million of depreciation.  Other satellites have likely been launched as well and are depreciating in orbit.That suggests that Starlink needs about 2-4x the paying customer base as today (depending on working life of satellites and launch costs, etc.) to break even.That's a lot better than I was expecting.Edit - someone pointed out that the $44M figure was mont	pclmulqdq	5.7631516	1.1753628	comment	11.0	57.0	1653780238	6.226963

This describes the case of a plane suddenly appearing in mid-air and starting to make noise, something, planes rarely do (maybe in the Bermuda triangle). It's like thunder after lightning, or seeing a ball fly before hearing it being kicked when you're far away.The aircraft, however, is flying for a long time, certainly it was flying and making noise much earlier than when it is passing the observer. As long as it flies subsonically, i.e. sound outpaces the aircraft - which is the case for every single commercial plane - the sound may be able to reach you much much earlier than the plane: As an example, take an aircraft flying with 100 m/s directly towards you.

There are some things that helium is truly essential for, like low temperature cryogenics and neutron detection. Our supply is finite and largely tied to natural gas reserves. When helium leaks out it floats into space and is gone forever. Why does the atmosphere in the drive absolutely have to be helium? Why not any other mix of inert gases at optimal pressure for a thin air cushion?Helium is also literally the leakiest thing you can try to contain. It will even diffuse out through the metal itself given enough time. Not trying to go full tinfoil hat here, but filling equipment with helium in this way seems like an effective way to cap drive life by time elapsed rather than amount of actual use.	yummypaint	5.3021054	1.5502367	comment	11.0	63.0	1614183750	-11.611985

You can make a drone operate on just about any frequency you want and with modern equipment becoming more frequency agile, this will only get worse.  A simple thought experiment would be a drone using GSM for video and control. Can you just jam all phones? Obviously not. Further, drones can fly without any command and control if they're configured correctly, just using GPS for guidance.  Can you jam GPS at an airport where planes are breaking out of an overcast layer at 200ft AGL on a GPS approach? Nope.Kinetic approaches: projectiles need to come back down.

Have automated patrols looking for fires daily, so that we can control small forest fires carefully- while letting them burn.	mabbo	5.824945	2.0465539	comment	12.0	80.0	1645654316	6.3415895

Independently of any clever aerodynamic design to moderate the drag coefficient, aerodynamic drag always increases like the velocity squared.  Doubling the speed will mean applying 4x the force for 1/2 the time, so all propulsive efficiencies being equal, you will expend twice the fuel to go the same distance - at an absolute minimum.  In reality engine efficiencies decrease at high-speeds, and you won't be able to completely eliminate the Mach 1 ""barrier"" (drag peak), or design an aircraft that is equally efficient in takeoff/landing... so the factor will be bigger than that.

(2) if weather was bad for a rocket launch on surface, would you fly a heavily laden giant plane into it?Leads me to wonder if the real customers of this is the military who do value very short turnaround launches.	sfifs	5.8905134	1.2219654	comment	13.0	74.0	1555253204	5.983256

Drone delivery only works with customers that have private backyards - so won't work in a city, since the payload is unsecured after the drones drop it off. In a suburban/rural context, density is lower, meaning that with the limited range of drones, distribution centers won't be able to take advantage of density. Thus the range of products available at each distribution center will be much lower (it's much more efficient from an inventory/logistics standpoint to have one distribution center in midtown Manhattan with many products, rather than many distribution centers spread across the suburbs of NYC, say), forcing customers to choose from a given list of a few hundred products.

Reusability is not a panacea. It increases complexity, decreases safety and much of the cost savings are mitigated by the fact that you have to carry extra fuel for the return back (thereby cutting into the amount of payload you can carry). The space shuttle was reusable and yet, it is generally seen as a disappointment (and I don't believe for a second SpaceX engineers are better than NASA engineers).	macspoofing	5.840832	1.1880684	comment	13.0	49.0	1616434977	6.1291556

Before 2010, we were doing just fine without executing citizens on suspect legal grounds.Edit: Edited to state that this was not fire of combatants in a combat zone.	pclmulqdq	5.843415	2.0647168	comment	13.0	56.0	1661364002	6.2059817

People used to be rooting for NASA and now they are rooting for a company that at the end of the day, will do as they please with the technology developed. Americans seem to prefer small government and 'offshore' everything to for-profit companies. In the future, what stops an American company from one day abandoning the USA to another country and leaving the USA without the infrastructure to do space travel anymore? (not familiar if there's regulation in place to stop this?) Or maybe this would just cause the price to rise in the USA for the same services.	lalos	5.949399	1.1006315	comment	14.0	59.0	1596951384	2.8879883

It has been designed and commissioned by people who believe that ""most advanced"" necessarily means ""best"" and who are indifferent to the actual tactical and strategic requirements.The Army and Marines have been crying out for years for a suitable replacement for the ageing A-10. It's the finest close support aircraft ever made, it has a legendary reputation among infantrymen who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the USAF are still planning on retiring it in favour of the F-35, an aircraft that is simply incapable of performing the same role.

Then it opened the largest hypersonic parachute ever to slow it down further (dropping the heat shield after it opened). Then eventually it cut off the parachute, turned on rockets, and flew sideways so that it didn't run back into the parachute. THEN, to avoid spitting up too much dust during landing, it lowered the rover on a 21 foot tether down to the surface, while hovering above it, before flying away to crash somewhere safe.[0]It's so ridiculous you'd think it came from a movie.

To find the leaks you'd have to pump the cryostat to high vacuum, hook up a portable mass spectrometer tuned to Helium to the pump circuit and then spray different parts of the cryostat with Helium from a regular gas canister. The He would then get sucked in through the leak and show up on the mass spectrometer, which was coupled to a loudspeaker so it would cause a sound whose pitch increased with the measured He density. Once you found the leak you had to vent the entire system, remove the faulty seal and replace it with a new one.

And we'd get to choose between 7 hours in a tiny metal tube with the seat-back of the person in front resting on your knees, or 24 hours on a slow blimp with a bed, the ability to walk around, and social areas.

30380150	The real problem for Starship (IMHO)	The real problem for Starship (IMHO) is Falcon 9. Falcon 9 is now the most reliable launch vehicle ever created. With reuse the may well be $10m per launch or even less by now and likely to continue to drop. F9 can deliver ~22t to LEO and smaller payloads to geosynchronous orbit. The payloads F9 can't deliver are quite small.What people forget is that payloads are deeply coupled to their launch vehicles. The launch vehicle will dictate the maximum weight and dimensions of the payload. You can't just take a payload designed for one vehicle and put it on another.The evidence for this is the relatively few Falcon Heavy launches we've had and are planned.So now SpaceX has all this launch capacity without the matching demand for it. It's a big part of why Starlink exists.Cheaper and larger payl	jmyeet	5.82652	1.1279702	comment	14.0	153.0	1645140397	6.1717696

While tragic, I don't know how a few individual cases can show that.Is there any actual statistics that support that claim? The article says that at least 24 workers have been killed while in the space industry since 1980. Compare that to coal fatalities, of which there were nearly 2,000 fatalities over the same period.SpaceX has 12,000 people and are making rockets so it seems like some degree of danger will be inherent. Of course this should be reduced where-ever possible, but if the claim is that the space industry is unnecessarily unsafe then I'm not sure that's convincing."	chrisfosterelli	6.056452	1.2165866	comment	14.0	82.0	1666118551	5.9834127

But to my surprise, they instead tend to be pessimists saying things like, ""You'll never get past my friends: the regulators, the government bureaucrats, and especially the lawyers!. We will drive up your costs and make you look foolish"".First, no one said that designing this thing in the USA means it has to be deployed in the USA. Countries without common law legal systems get around these unnecessary costs much easier.Second, if these are seriously the only objections, then thank god we are actually building this thing.

The single most important job humanity has is to get our eggs into more than one basket. The FAA is standing athwart the most effective effort to move in that direction, yelling Stop.

They literally don't care about price as long as they get the lethality and qty. they want.Hence they will never look at low-cost fighters like the F-5, A-10 or A-29 for their own use, except as maybe trainers or Marine use.The F-22 is no longer made. Around 189 were built and there's about 150 left. It's a great plane, but the low count is a great concern in case of war (with China.) You can lose 150 planes in a couple of days in a kinetic war.The F-35 has numerous show-stopping problems, plus even more numerous irritating problems. The US needs about 1,000 operational ones, plus another 1,000 for our allies, to be an effective deterrent to China.	redis_mlc	5.882525	2.20666	comment	15.0	67.0	1619701724	6.03104

But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way.

Who am I to judge- I've been there.[1] They were going to launch about 20 minutes ago actually, but scrubbed at the last minute.

WW2 was then fought using entirely new tactics and strategies enabled by tanks (not least ""blitzkrieg"").Britain and France, notably, hadn't really worked out how to use them effectively and so were left fighting the last war, horribly disadvantaged until they worked out how to catch up (though air power being developed at the same time also had an influence).So now we have drones, and all those incredibly expensive fighter planes are useless. Aircraft carriers will be replaced with cheap drone swarm carriers, so naval strategy will need to change. Anti-tank drone swarms will make conventional armour more or less ineffective. And so on.The good news is that there will be anti-drone swarms"	marcus_holmes	5.8677716	2.1327295	comment	16.0	104.0	1623853442	6.3221126

The launch site itself is tiny and directly adjacent to protected wetlands, the only access between the build and launch sites is via a two-lane public road which is the only access to the also-adjacent state park beach, etc.There were other sites under consideration, and I'm sure they had their reasons for passing on them, but it's hard to see offhand how they could be worse than Boca Chica.

The space shuttle already holds that title.I'm also kindof curious why they decided to go with a vertical-landing-design, instead of putting some wings on it and having it glide home like the shuttle did.  Is that a weight-concern?  Aerodynamics, mabye, but couldn't the wings be articulated in the same way that the landing legs are right now?(I will admit some ignorance in this field.

At the moment, the US still has zero chance of defending against a single MIRV'd ICBM, let alone the hundreds that Russia would use.

They have a pretty good engineering team, and that aspect didn't involve an anomaly, it was the vehicle operating as planned at launch. But admitting the inadequacy of the launch facility would've undoubtedly led to significant delays. Fortunately for SpaceX, the rocket blew up, which will draw media attention away from the damage on and around the launchpad.	vannevar	5.924915	1.2364117	comment	17.0	120.0	1682009329	5.8957925

26251960	“The F-35 has failed” is a strong st	“The F-35 has failed” is a strong statement that depends on what your definition of success is. Did it fail because it couldn’t replace the F-16? Did it fail because it’s expensive and bloated?Do those things even matter?I’m not defending the F-35 but anyone deeply and intimately familiar with the platform knows and understands that it is a Ferrari. You don’t bring your Acura TSX to a Formula 1 race track to win a race. Just like you don’t bring your Ferrari to the farm to haul material (not anymore anyways).The F-35 may be a Ferrari; but the thing about Ferraris is that their technology trickles down. Now we have electric cars with carbon fiber shells. The same is true for the F-35. The technology inside it has and will lead to the resurrection and long standing use of older planes like t	digi59404	5.778378	2.223979	comment	18.0	140.0	1614184772	6.0489774

Most of the US military, the best funded in the world, is decades behind the private sector on computing technology -- it's honestly unthinkable to me that their propulsion technology would be decades (or centuries) ahead. The best engineers and scientists have taken Silicon Valley jobs paying 5-10x more since the late 90's.And why are we acting like this is a new phenomenon? It's been going on since at least the 1940's, when there should be little doubt that we didn't have technology to explain it.While I've never seen anything personally, and my anecdote is meaningless to others, I have a family story dating back to ~1969-1970 that either means a bunch of sane fa	lend000	5.8285036	2.0020943	comment	18.0	130.0	1687974997	6.3558326

Easy enough (albeit still pricey) to use the likes of iridium for internet everywhere. No longer so important to reach your destination fast.Thirdly, technology. No longer does the thing need to be stuffed with hydrogen - rather helium. Give it a little while and we can stuff it with vacuum in spun carbon vessels. In place of the fossil driven air-screws, make the entire thing a fat flying wing, cover the top in PV, use electric propulsion.Finally, given the ever increasing popularit	madaxe_again	5.428208	1.7083931	comment	19.0	94.0	1495290749	-11.584562

Case in point: Falcon Heavy. It ended up being delayed so long that improvements in the Merlin engine greatly reduced the payloads that Falcon Heavy was originally built for to the point there are a couple of launches a year at best.Musk does deserve a lot of credit for SpaceX. The Falcon 9 vehicle is arguably the most reliable launch system we've ever made [1]. It's cheap to produce and launch. It's even cheaper once you factor in reuse. Starlink will probably be a game changer for many (but it isn't yet). But that doesn't matter because Starlink is driving down launch costs (with reuse) and improving the Falcon 9 track record.All of this for	jmyeet	5.823072	1.1339154	comment	19.0	165.0	1644934318	6.133755

Space X's revenue is 10 times the GDP of Tonga. There will be no real oversight of this billionaire on the loose.	flexie	6.225936	1.3240514	comment	19.0	141.0	1697121040	4.13813

Launch sequence and takeoff, stage separation and Starship engine light, and the post-launch stuff like booster wet landing, reentry, and heat tiles. The booster by itself is not aerodynamic, so the only way to test x is with a starship on top. And if you have starship, you might as well test y and z. But it's not a primary goal. Any more effort in polishing y and z is ""premature optimization"". X was the test. SpaceX did the X, we got max Q.On the most recent SmarterEveryDay video on encasing a Prince Rupert's drop in glass, sculptor Cal Breed talks about the moment when a process fails.

China has no shortage of high quality spy satellites.I don't think it's obvious what the purpose is. It's clearly very large, probably reasonably pricey.

So is one expensive F-35 capable enough of taking on 3 cheaper (yet sophisticated enough jets read up on JF-17 recent achievements)?

The root problem with this aircraft is that people prefer cheaper flights over faster flights.The real success that we can take from the Concorde program was that some of the technology found its way into the A300 program and its derivative, the A320.Cheap, reliable aircraft are what people want.

If Musk appears to be doing something crazy you've not understood it.> It’s crazy, completely crazy. Elon Musk has read too much science fiction. He got carried away with it. If I were in his position, I would not waste my fortune on colonizing Mars. And all they would learn is how awful it is up there: You can't breathe the air, the pressure of the atmosphere is a tiny fraction of what we have on Mount Everest.Instead of straw manning Musk and implying he doesn't know about the composition of Mar's atmosphere, try steel manning him and trying to figure out what he's doing.Musk has captured the imagination of financiers, engineers and the public a	keanzu	6.1533046	1.1885784	comment	22.0	218.0	1580740028	6.324004

Drones can be lighter, turn harder and crucially not endanger the life of the operator. Why is the MOD committing £2bn to building new ones? Fighter aircraft historically take decades to be developed. The current typhoon mentioned in the article began life in 1983, before I had my teenage plane fascination and subscription to takeoff magazine, and as far as I know the UK is still waiting on delivery of some of the initial orders, 35 years later.

But after taking some video around my house, I'm honestly not sure what I would do with one.

We don't see these things because they are hard problems that require basic technological breakthroughs that may not yet exist.
