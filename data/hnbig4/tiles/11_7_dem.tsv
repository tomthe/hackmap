33071062	OChem tends to be the weed-out class	OChem tends to be the weed-out class for several majors, primarily Chemistry. You often take it as a college sophomore, and represents a fundamental shift in topics. Most high school and introductory chemistry is acid/base aqueous chemistry, which is relatively straightforward HAcid + BaseOH <-> H20 + Salt. You may do an organic reaction here or there, but only the the most basic like esterification. Making the fake banana flavor is pretty common, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoamyl_acetate.The article is paywalled, so I didn't read, but OChem is supposed to be very hard. Maybe he did grade too hard, or maybe whiners want a passing grade without doing the work and this is the first academic challenge they have truly faced.	dexwiz	7.393165	0.2198149	comment	3.0	11.0	1664819274	-0.8562026
33074274	I completed medical school back in 2	"I completed medical school back in 2012. Here's the unfortunate rub with this particular class--organic chemistry is a requisite for medical school and probably shouldn't be. The class is mostly pre-med students and very few chemistry majors. It seems that once upon a time some administrators decided that students should complete 2 years of chemistry and organic chemistry happened to be the most common second year course available.Physics courses, at least at my alma mater, were separated in to physics for physics majors(""honors physics""), physics for engineers, and physics for life sciences. A similar structure would be a great compromise to maintain the quality of education for those continuing on to perform organic synthesis versus those who want to be physicians.

The “P=0.05” cutoff we use to “reject” a hypothesis is an arbitrary one. When I read papers, I never “accept” or “reject” hypotheses but rather consider likelihood quantification as a measure of the weight of evidence or a distance of the data from some null hypothesis, as measured by some statistic. I encourage everyone else to consider this probabilistic worldview when viewing our paper: we aimed to quantify probabilities of this system occurring in nature, and P-values were convenient and commonly understood ways of communicating quantiles.

Cave fish today see as well as cave fish 100,000 years ago.	300bps	6.608234	0.0024380893	comment	3.0	11.0	1667216599	7.228634

You reduce the necessary certainty if you have confidence on your priors, and increase it if you test many different hypotheses.

No, professional scientists are rarely that callous with their time.There was a slim possibility that our understanding of physics was wrong, and now we know for sure that this was not an instance of that.But everything that's really interesting happens at the edges.

Mass would be N atoms.So why are they not using a single element to define everything?  Is it a matter of finding the proper element that is easy to excite and stable enough (chemically and atomically) over the long term? Sodium is very reactive and easy to excite.

This assumption of horizontal travel is incredibly deeply engrained in humans, to the point that the English language doesn’t even have up/down equivalents to the words “left” and “right”, i.e. a word that means the direction closer to your head than to your feet regardless of your orientation.	twhb	6.5706635	-0.12948242	comment	3.0	11.0	1623893399	6.8439755

In the following demonstration, you can apply two forces of the same magnitude to two identical boxes. The only difference is the distance to the center of mass  at which these forces act:> When the distance between the force-line and the center of mass is large, the box spins faster as well. That distance doesn’t change the acceleration of the box to the right and both boxes move with the same linear speed. However, that distance affects the angular acceleration of a box – the longer that arm, the faster the box spins.This does not make sense to me. If the two forces are truly of equal magnitude, then shouldn't the one that is in-line with the center of mass accelerate it faster, 	margalabargala	6.3765674	-0.03469892	comment	3.0	11.0	1680022161	5.0986576

It’s very difficult to catch up (in Central European schools at least). A bout of pneumonia could negatively impact your whole life if you miss a week of school and you don’t have the time or teaching to catch up. Education can be very rushed, maybe it shouldn’t be. Pupils should be given time to catch up when various life events happen to them.

The challenge is more about what happens next in their career — can these kids get affordable higher education, and a career track that values their gift?

This was just by doing self-study with off the shelf test prep material. The classes aren't what increases your score, its the consistent structured study and ones innate potential. For some people, no amount of study is going to get them into the 90+th percentile. While others who have the capacity to do well but haven't had the best instruction over the years can cover a lot of ground with the right prep. But this is exactly what SAT is intended to measure, scholastic potential. That some people can increase scores dramatically through preparation does not indicate a failure of the test, but rather its success.	hackinthebochs	7.4439445	0.99649775	comment	3.0	19.0	1584724913	-2.2704136

This creates even more messed up incentives but this time facing students and teachers as opposed to institutional practices.I think that assessment, when decoupled, can't be done with an institution or institutions.

While it's able to apply some level of reasoning, can form sentences, understands you for the most part, and knows a lot of things, it fail to both have its own strong opinion of things, with a reasoning behind it, and at being consistent in it's reasoning.For example, if you ask it what it thinks are the best of something. And then it answers you it's X for those reasons. And then you ask it why not Y, it'll often just change it's mind: You're right, Y is always great, and could be the best.And if you challenge it's reasoning it'll similarly often go back and forth.It's little things like this that	didibus	7.373975	0.23517126	comment	3.0	11.0	1697658059	-6.92715

4 years, of which 2 years are ""core"" coursework and 2 years are general education.2 Years * 2 semesters per year * 15 weeks per semester * 15 credit hours per week = 900 hours for a degree.Lambda School:  
6 months * 4 weeks per month * 40 hours per week = 960.Obviously this doesn't account for a number of variables such as 0-credit ""mandatory"" labs, out-of-class work/projects/studying, but a Lambda student who spends an extra 5-10 hours per week during the program would end up with 1000-1200 total hours.But thi"	calderarrow	7.2206106	1.0702902	comment	3.0	10.0	1619738355	14.996287

He was championing the very thing that they abhorred: religious mysticism.When Wittgenstein said ""Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.""  He meant it in a respectful way, as a defense of religious mysticism.  The Logical Positivists assumed that attitude in the exact opposite direction: to attack religious mysticism and religion in general.  They labeled it as meaningless nonsense.

For example, so far, we have not discovered any dark matter particles. This does not rule out that we will discover them, but for us humans (consisting of protons, neutrons and electrons) it will not have any effect. Because if it would, we already would have discovered them. The existence of other particles, like neutrino's, which zip through our bodies by the billions every day, also have no effect. We are of course effected by photons in some energy spectrums. In view of this, I think it is very unlickly that we discover any new physics which would allow us to communicate with aliens.	fjfaase	6.5728326	0.08007631	comment	3.0	12.0	1569238296	6.998523

If only the top 20% of students are taking the test, as used to be the case, then the average score is going to be quite high.  If you expand that pool with weaker students, it's going to pull the average down.  If you make everyone take the SAT, then you are going to wind up with a lot of really low scores dragging that average down hard.They run into this all the time with mandated standardized testing.

It's very difficult to imagine how (or even why) one would ever build a device that takes advantage of a TeV scale effect to do something useful, given that these effects are meaningless to the sorts of matter we care about and interact with.Is it possible that we might discover something revolutionary at 100TeV that will have gigantic consequences to our daily lives? Sure. But that's like saying that it's possible that there's a treasure chest full of gold buried in your backyard.

23137347	As a practicing physicist in quantum	"As a practicing physicist in quantum information, I can say(1) ""New physics"" is jargon understood by experts to mean new fundamental physics, i.e., new laws/forces/particles at the base of our theoretical edifice.  This does not mean that non-fundamental physics is necessarily less important -- see for instance the late Phillip Anderson's ""More is different"" [ https://science.sciencemag.org/content/177/4047/393 ] -- but the distinction is real and meaningful.  The use of this phrase does not equate physics with HEP physics.  The reason you might make that mistake is because...(2) To my knowledge, every single discovery of new physics in the past half century years has been made with a particle accelerator.

Percentiles and the median, except for symmetric distributions, are not as easy to work with.

Why do we need to lie to ourselves so?> If you're already deeply interested in computer science, of course the detailed narrative recognizing dozens of brilliant early computer scientists is richer. Of course!Personally I'm mostly uninterested in who did what, but maybe that's just me. It seems obvious to me that nearly every scientific discovery could have been done equally well by millions of people, it's just a matter of who had the resources to be educated, who decided to research the problem, who managed to snipe the answer first, and who had the right connections to get it acknowledged.

Instead of teaching mechanics-- techniques specifically for solving olympiad problems (as they had done a lot of before, and as many countries do), the idea was to just show interesting and fun things from real math and build strong intuition for mathematical problem solving through that. If you look at lecture's he's given in the past at MOP: http://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/olympiad.shtml, you can see they're mostly just highlights from his area of research.When he was being considered for coaching he told the MAA he would run training for the IMO team in a very different way from how it was done and how and that choosing him would be a gamble: there was a	liamuk	7.387948	0.0063898144	comment	3.0	11.0	1470294344	0.8285233

This makes training your own workforce untenable for any cognitively demanding field, so we must use proxies like college education. However, one of the most important findings in psychometrics is the fact that scores on all cognitive tests are correlated. Thus there seems to be an opening for a company that is able to skillfully embed IQ tests in tests that are inarguably domain-relevant, and can be argued as such in court. If you can create an abundance of such tests for various occupations, this would seem valuable. Because psychometrics is both wildly unpopular and correct, this is exactly the type of secret, in Thiel's terms, one might expect to be under-appreciated.

But if a person deliberately tries to cram for an IQ test, they may increase their score, without increasing their general intelligence.

If you want to know what great education at the time looked like, read up on Summerhill -- it was founded in 1921 but humanistic education has been around for centuries.	chx	7.506669	0.8387879	comment	3.0	13.0	1573818853	7.1298604

If the effects were plausibly non-linear, we would need 1 trillion+ data points even to establish statistically significant differences.These fields are all cargo-cult stats, putting data into GUIs and printing pro-forma reports.

This, among many other data points, has led me to question the entire concept of IQ.The measurement of IQ borders on pseudo-science. It measures something, but what exactly? Everyone has a different answer. Ok, sure, intelligence. Now try to define ""intelligence"" empirically. What isn't a particular IQ test measuring that is relevant to intelligence? Different IQ tests often yield different results. And I'm not talking about online tests, but proctored tests administered by professionals.How do you account for that amorphous quality known as ""intuition""? You can't measure it or quantify it.

But it is not precise, and is useful, as I said, only in the broadest strokes. And like all psychometrics, the manner in which it is measured is itself not stable.But comparing intelligence to mass or any other physical measurement is a non sequitur. Mass is precisely measurable with perfectly repeatable results, and has perfectly repeatable interactions.	teilo	7.395342	0.4929072	comment	3.0	13.0	1538661005	-4.0612984

This is misleading, because it falsely counts winners of the ""The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences Prize in Economic Sciences"" as a Nobel price. Alfred Nobel did not donate a price for economics. The Sveriges Riksbank (= bank of the swedish empire) created this price (against the explicit wishes of the Nobel foundation [1]) in order to 'cash' in on the reputation of Nobel price.

As a clay crystal grows and splits, the info in the crystal's defect structure is replicating with impressive fidelity, and those defects also interact with the surroundings.  So you get the Darwinian game bootstrapped pretty much for free.  Later on, the crystals start using organic polymers; later still, the polymer technology is developed well enough to take over from the clay.  So this might make abiogenesis reasonably probable on one planet.2) An observable universe is just any epsilon size patch, on an inflationary universe.

30309258	Physics is full of concepts that are	Physics is full of concepts that are counterintuitive. Inertia is an early example of one such concept. But ideas are adopted based on their explanatory power, and one way you get places is with an ethos called 'shut up and calculate'. I.e., don't think too hard about the 'counterintuitive' nature of what the theories predict, crunch the numbers and figure out what the predictions are and leave the implications to the philosophers.Once you accept that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, relativity falls out from that. That in itself is a bit hard to accept, though, which was why it was some number of years between the Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 and Einstein's paper on SR in 1905.

E.g, leetcode tests in FAANG interviews are defacto IQ tests since interviewers are told to evaluate the candidate for ""general cognitive ability"" when asking leetcode questions, but they are still used for FAANG interviews because the companies realized that they correlate to job performance. I don't know of any formal MBTI studies related to engineers, but my anecdotal data suggests that xNTx MBTIs are disproportionately present in SV. So there might be a useful reason to ask about MBTI in an interview, but it would be bad to decline a candidate based on their MBTI unless there was hard data suggesting it affected job performance."	sxp	7.4387035	0.759953	comment	3.0	10.0	1647408044	-3.978939

Generally, once that happens, it cannot be undone:1) malnutrition at a young age. Meaning under 3 years old or so. Malnutricion during breast feeding or pregnancy is the most damaging. After a few years it mostly stops mattering.2) some chemical contaminants, most notably (and commonly) lead. There are others (and worse ones), like Cadmium, but they're not very common at all.3) genetic predisposition. Most pronounced, but far from the only effect, is Down syndrome. Of course there are genetic problems, like epilepsy, that are bad enough to make you an idiot.4) any contact whatsoever with child services has a strong negative effect.

In fact a career on the periphery of academia, academic testing, and their efficacy in predicting academic success at the University level, I have never, not once, not from any colleague or at any conference encountered mention of an IQ test as something to be considered for practical use. I have a lesser degree of familiarity with grade school/high school testing methods, but (in the US) I am similarly unaware of any common practice here.	ineedasername	7.438904	0.766517	comment	3.0	17.0	1546393679	-3.972223

What IQ fails at is being an ABSOLUTE measure of those things, e.g. John Nash is a genius, but his schizophrenia likely made a lot of what he did and said questionable. Just taking IQ and ignoring other factors would lead you awry. Even then, John Nash came up with the Nash Equilibrium.I think the mistake is thinking that one measure will be absolutely predictive. Nassim Nicholas Taleb's point is that IQ is a great measure of stupid people, almost absolute at < 70 IQ levels, but as you progress upwards it's predictive power wanes.Which is GOOD.

The outcome of each ""pseudoexperiment"" is boiled down to a single number, known as a test-statistic, and this way we can generate a distribution of that test statistic that gives you an idea of the probability of any given outcome.

The lowest level triggers are actually embedded in FPGAs on the detector itself, then there is a high-level trigger that runs on an on-site server farm that does minimal event processing to see if the even is interesting.All of this requires us to define what constituents an interesting event.

The finding was that certain wheather patterns can be modelled better than before by using a quantum physics equation. To further the point: The model of this quantum physics equation is also useful for quantum computers built with superconducting materials.Underlying is the question though, why does this equation apply to the earths wheather?
There seem to be parallels in the quantum and ""macro"" model, like windings of electron and wheather currents. Maybe the right view to modeling the earth is about dynamics as much as it is about topoligical phenomenons. After all, topology is used for solving gravitational problems, too.Then why can the earth can be treated as a topoligical insulator and what implications does this have?

Four million elements, two million of them unique, in the range [-0.1, 1.1], and failing to account for two elements can get your answer wrong by +/- 1.0.U"	feoren	7.4787264	0.2751602	comment	3.0	11.0	1704396989	-0.12735376

I would argue since the universe lacks omniscience, omnipotence, consciousness, and by extension, will power it is a far simpler entity than God. So saying the universe has existed forever and saying God has existed forever are therefore two vastly different statements due to the different complexities inherent in the two different entities being compared. The universe is far, far, far simpler a construct than God and by using Occam's Razor I conclude a universe that has existed forever is far more likely than a God that has existed forever.	taylodl	6.9867325	0.1100302	comment	3.0	11.0	1655918548	2.8333774

The fact that the age of the child at the time of the IQ test is such a large factor is often not accounted for in research, which creates inconsistent results.

Could Zeus or Thor or whatever exist? Sure; there's no way to prove their non-existence. Do we need them to explain things? No.It's similar here. We certainly don't need some elusive concept of ""sentience"" to explain chat bots. Not yet."	oefrha	7.3601646	-0.05796252	comment	3.0	29.0	1658552036	-7.1451383

But, if that were so, it would undermine all our confidence in the very belief that the human mind is a product of evolution, making that a self-defeating idea.Hence, if the human mind is a product of evolution, evolution must ultimately prefer truth to falsehood.

To learn something, you need a problem, you need to grapple with the problem for a bit, and then you can be presented with a solution. Then, the answer to why is clear: Because it will solve this problem.Education would still have to artificially give students problems; waiting for students to naturally have a problem for which taking the derivative of a tan function and then leaping in to discuss that just doesn't scale in all sorts of ways.

You can't believe in both Creationism and evolution because Creationism is an explicit denial of evolution, and of anything but a literal reading of Genesis.

But that many?An IEP is a catch-all term for anything that requires special adjustment for a student. What the adjustment is varies depending on the situation--there's a reason it's called individualized.Having gone to one of those ""elite public schools"", it wouldn't surprise me if that large a fraction of kids had an IEP (hell, I did).

As a kind of mental aid, I used 'F' as the total effort needed to make the change, while 'm' represented the size of the organization, and 'a' would represent the speed we wanted to perform the change with. F = m * a. A simple way of illustrating the exponential relationship between these factors.But it blew their mind. It took on 'mystical' properties, as if we had distilled change management into pure Newtonian motion. I started seeing not only F = ma in memos on other issues, but also other equations like E = mc^2, trying to wrestle management lingo into relativistic conservation of energy.Lesson learned, I guess.	playeren	6.403341	-0.060647905	comment	3.0	37.0	1664110148	-7.7848635

One of the huge problems was that we had a top-grade for people who went “beyond” expectations for the course. Because “beyond” is up for interpretation, some examiners were more likely to give it than others, but in general it was just extremely hard to earn a top mark and no one really knew what was needed to get it.So we changed it to make it similar to pretty much every other country. Now roughly 10 years later, it looks like we might change it again because people are missing the old “exceptional” grade.Only it isn’t students, educators or examinators who miss it.

The way to determine causality here is through a combination of physical laws and controlled experimentation [1]. In fact, we have plenty of causal models (e.g. 1st principles physics-based models, or design-of-experiments models). Without these models, machines/control systems/etc would not work.The trouble is, outside of these 1st-order effect dominant, deterministic environments, causality becomes much harder. In complex systems, stochasticity, nonlinearity, feedback loops and higher-order effects dominate. There's also emergent behavior -- properties that are true in the small are not true in the large.Consider a complex system like human society -- can we truly determine causal	wenc	7.03436	0.009368494	comment	3.0	18.0	1603996080	13.057119

Formally you'd compute the p value (in this case something like 1/1024 or 2/1024 depending on if you do a one sided or two sided test). You'd compare this with some cutoff, perhaps 0.05 and claim that you can reject the null hypothesis.So far so good.Now let's perform that experiment again but this time instead of having one fair coin and one biased coin in the bag, suppose we have one biases coin and 10^1000 fair coins.

While your conclusion would likely be incorrect, you almost never run into that scenario.For example, if you conducted a study every week for 20 years, you'd both be extremely prolific and expect to have drawn about one wrong conclusion.The example is a case of an absurd premise (i.e., a fair coin comes up heads 10 times in a row) leading to an absurd conclusion (that the coin is biased). Of course, this is exactly the guarantee the hypothesis test provides: under robust assumptions, you'll draw the wrong conclusion only rarely.	nickhuh	7.3348436	-0.0991438	comment	3.0	12.0	1604900966	-6.0828094

In short, unless the natural sciences are inherently bunk, it's a logical necessity that there exists something outside their scope, literally super-natural.It's an imperfect analogy but I always come back to the idea of CPU privileg	torstenvl	7.215869	-0.13994215	comment	3.0	31.0	1634273407	-2.16069

It's just a garbage process that's guaranteed to produce high % of falsehoods, where the exact % depends on the prior probability of starting with true hypotheses.Obligatory XKCD: https://xkcd.com/882/I mean think about the Newtonian mechanics, there really isn't almost any room for error.

28948605	Years and years ago I read Einstein'	Years and years ago I read Einstein's biography (the one by Isaacson). One anecdote that remains bright in my memory after all these years is about Einstein and sailing. Einstein liked sailing, and because of where he was living he mostly did lake sailing. One thing about lake sailing is that you can often end up becalmed. What Einstein did was to take a notebook with him when he went sailing; a notebook with notes about what he was working on at the time. Whenever the wind died down he would take out his notebook and start working on his current research. When the wind picked up he would put his notebook away and resume sailing.There is no doubt that Einstein was brilliant. I believe he was as successful as he was because he was also exceptionally self disciplined.	inetsee	7.0429053	-0.050258417	comment	3.0	15.0	1634839771	-1.3794184

We might be able to come up with better refinements, better techniques, slightly better computers, etc. But sooner or later we are going to hit a physical limit, and we are going to need to seriously enlarge our fundamental knowledge corpus of how the universe operates if we are going to keep moving forward.	aduitsis	6.537496	-0.041922234	comment	3.0	31.0	1593358374	-8.656992

it gets worse: the average IQ of African blacks is lower
still, not far above what is considered the threshold of mental
retardation in the U.S. And yes, it’s genetic; g seems to be about
85% heritable, and recent studies of effects like regression towards

It always feels very strange to me that people trying to compress aptitude into a single number say that they're defending differentiation or diversity of talent.MIT's findings here don't really change my view of the value of SATs, although the findings are interesting and I think they're worth looking into further.

These systems are often intertwined and networked in unintuitive ways and just because something appears on multiple panes of glass does not necessarily mean it’s been independently confirmed.	nostromo	6.673732	0.7505455	comment	3.0	15.0	1675644182	5.8482747

Erik Hoel, who has written a series of great essays about why we stopped making Einsteins (here, here, and here), singled out “aristocratic tutoring” as the most important factor. (In this term, Erik includes not only tutoring, in its classical sense, but also more casual interactions between children and competent adults.)If I had to guess, the reason is much of the low hanging fruit has been picked.

36953725	Hope the air's good in the tower...G	Hope the air's good in the tower...Good science has often proceeded from 'weird' observations, leading to experiments trying to isolate the weirdness. The weird is necessarily outside the zone of existing theory, and requires experimentation to recreate the effect reliably and quantifiably. Once that's done, you can iterate on conjectures and experiments to try to get to the bottom of what's going on.In reality, I suspect that the divide between theorists and experimentalists is really only a fundamental physics thing. And physics has been more-or-less at an impasse for the last thirty years, so that there are relatively few experiments worth running, and the bulk of the theorists are just (making stuff/rebranding as mathematicians) up because they don't know what else to do.In other areas	sdenton4	6.987725	-0.15687215	comment	3.0	15.0	1690878527	-3.1864903

A stupid rich person will always be stupid, but a smart rich person will probably have access to better schools, private tutoring, and test preparation resources.So there's the challenge that the anti-testing/testing reform crowd wants to solve: how do you call testing meritocratic when the equality of opportunity isn't there?

It wasn't a matter of not working hard or being lazy.He realized the error of his ways... that the intense pressure he put on his daughter was wrong.I can't seem to find that article anymore.

The tests used are however not the same as most people have done online, like WAIS (but for kids. Can't remember the name of it).	bjoli	7.431867	0.77008677	comment	3.0	22.0	1614513969	-4.066395

Now can we do the same with the other fourteen types, or is the primary value here that there are two kinds of people: INTx and non-INTx?There's probably some bias here, but I've only ever heard INTx specifically singled out when talking about MBTI. That suggests that MBTI may make too many clear distinctions where reality draws a much softer line. A coarser-grained theory is likely to have more predictive power and be more applicable. Alternatively, a fine-grained theory with the boundaries drawn differently, such as the Big Five, may better account for these softer distinctions.I'm not saying this is definitively the case. I'm saying that a complex theory that makes a small set of predictions doesn't justify its weight.

Trauma, Alcoholism, and other diseases can also lower scores dramatically.  You can correlate adult IQ’s with tests taken by 2 year olds, but the individual raw scores again vary significantly.It seems stable because of how age is adjusting for and the huge sweet spot where 64.2% of the population is grouped between 85 and 115.

I could pass the class with the final alone, and didn't care about the grade very much. Anyway, by skipping class I didn't know the final was rescheduled!Luckily the professor let me take the final on my own later in the library, though he'd thought I had skipped it because I had a near-zero on the quizzes that were worth a few percentage points going into the final. However, there was a section on Taylor series which I hadn't seen before on the final, so I was certain that I had bombed it.I wrote a long email talking about possible summer projects or something, so that I'd have the prerequisites for the next year.

That doesn't really map cleanly on to replication. A master database doesn't really own or control the slave database; it just provides a log of actions performed against it that the slave needs to mimic.As I understand history, the master/slave metaphor has been used for a long time in technology (e.g., in machinery and photography), well before computers or software, but we have better terminology.

20429670	Just for argument’s sake, my opinion	Just for argument’s sake, my opinion is that intelligence is a kind of social construct. What we view as “intelligence” is the manifestation of traits that are important for our current society to function. i.e, we value bridges, so the traits of bridge builders are viewed as positive traits, which we call “intelligence”. In other environments these traits might not be seen as intelligent. For example, from what I’ve gleaned from reading books written a hundred or so years ago, “intelligence” could only be possessed by members of the upper classes, so even if you could build bridges, if you weren’t born into a certain class you were seen as mentally inferior. So our definition of intelligence shifts over time based on whatever society deems as important.	renlo	7.3942285	0.47900444	comment	3.0	12.0	1563045449	-6.585882

And most of the studies don't even use this model, and fallback to a frankly ridiculous trait model.The two fundamental distinctions made by the theory are introversion/extraversion and ""judgement""/""perception"" aka rational/irrational which remarkably similar to Dual-process theory's System 1 and System 2 thinking (as popularised by Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow).Both of these models have a ton of experimental evidence validating them"	nicoburns	7.43301	0.5860894	comment	3.0	16.0	1567698508	-8.463527

My understanding of his example (~1h10 into https://youtu.be/JtwBwogRZkI) is that a 400 sized probability sample (a small random sample from the whole population) is often better than a millions sized administrative sample (of the kind you can download from gov sites).

Even if it's unlikely that you'll get the result you expect with 5% likelihood, there are enough people doing enough tests that you're going to have 5% wrong answers. And that philosophical problem doesn't go away by choosing a different percentage.Likewise, we're supposed to assume that there is something magical about our prior assumptions? Why? Where is it written that our null and alternative hypothesis should conform to what is true, when our best ability to predict the future (as people) is based on our past experience? The world doesn't always behave predictably, and yet that seems to be baked into the assumption of every regression test ever run.

But my dad forced me to go the engineering route and I  switched my major. Two decades later, I often wonder what my life would have been if I hadn't done what he told me. Physics is super hard and regardless of my passion and devotion I don't think I would have been very good at it (I can't even do dynamic programming problems asked in coding interviews - so unlikely I would have done any useful research in physics). I would have been languishing as a professor in some unknown college making significantly less money. But the dream hasn't died out though. I still fantasize about being a physicist working on black holes or cosmology. But I have accepted it will forever remain a dream.	monster_group	7.4089437	0.005520939	comment	4.0	13.0	1621686925	1.1308483

I threw it towards a wall and it burst at time t = 10. from the observing that water flow at time t= 12 and t =13. i can say water originated from a single location. and at time t =10, water was in 5 cm balloon shaped form. at time t=9, it was in 3 cm balloon form, at time t=2, water was concentrated in form of 2 mm ballon. and so on.does bing bang theory suffers from the same issue?	rk06	6.4000435	-0.020122675	comment	4.0	12.0	1622000210	-5.192735

Philosophers of science must actually study the focus of their research. Those working in metaphysics must ensure their theories do not conflict with those of physicists (or ensure they conflict in interesting and valid ways).But what of ethics, aesthetics, politics and other more humanistic branches of philosophy requires those doing working within them to keep pace with the latest developments in physics and maths?	jmcmichael	7.437089	0.020736277	comment	4.0	25.0	1481895820	-0.13902888

Wittgenstein's ladder is a metaphor used by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein to explain how language and ideas work.Imagine you want to get to the top of a tree. At first, you might use a ladder to climb up. But once you get to the top, you don't need the ladder anymore. You can throw it away or leave it behind.In the same way, Wittgenstein argued that language is like a ladder. It's a tool we use to get to a certain point, but once we've reached that point, we don't need the language anymore. We can throw it away or leave it behind.For example, imagine you're learning to count. You might use your fingers to help you count to five.

Such a hypothesis also, and more importantly, has to provide a better explanation of some phenomenon than the current best theory.  Experimental evidence is only brought to bear to decide among plausible alternative theories after the vast majority of candidate theories have been eliminated for not providing good explanations.It's easy to see that this must be true because we can only ever have a finite amount of data, and that will always be consistent with an infinite number of falsifiable theories (c.f. Russell's teapot).  So data cannot possibly help us choose from among those.	lisper	7.466315	0.10602747	comment	4.0	52.0	1557604895	-5.6447697

While it's fair to point out that a theory makes everything more complicated and thus might make it less likely to be sound, it's not fair to push back on the first bit of research into a theory because they haven't had the time to fully develop it.Indeed, a scientific revolution generally starts by treating as false an assumption previously held as true.  Not to say that this is a revolution, but if you push back too hard it won't be, whether it's true or not.	khawkins	7.0401015	0.24212217	comment	4.0	31.0	1544208996	-13.108186

What they are good for is sorting and labeling the students, though as a side effect they are also quite effective at directing student effort toward gaming them rather than caring about the quality of their work.My primary school eschewed grades in favor of detailed written progress reports.

Many of the text books more or less teach dumbed down versions of what a Biology undergraduate university student would learn in their first semesters — heavy on the theory, but hampered by a lack of rigorous mathematical etc underpinnings.My father, who was a biology teacher, advocated that high school biology should be taught largely for the benefit of the vast majority of students who would never take another biology class in their life — a self contained curriculum focusing on nature observation and on practical interactions of biology with the world.I went through a high school curriculum focused on classical languages, and went on to a math-heavy CS school.

We appreciate why this is necessary for those fields, that there is a difference between science research and science communication.

Then positing Thoery X + God is a model with strictly more moving parts and equal explanatory power as Theory X alone.On a wider level, explanations like ""God did it"" tend to operate on the same level as calling the phenomenon ""magic""---it's an analysis that doesn't really provide any actionable information on how to influence said phenomenon.In that way, I personally see ""magic"" and ""God"" as operating more in the realm of storytelling.

17073561	"In a letter

of October or November, 1674, Spinoza writes:Thus, I call a thing free that exists and acts out
of the pure necessity of its nature; and I call it compelled, if its existence and activity are determined
in a precise and fixed manner by something else.
Thus God, for example, though necessary, is free,
because he exists only out of the necessity of his
nature. Similarly, God knows himself and everything else freely, because it follows from the necessity of his nature alone that he should know
everything. You see, then, that I locate freedom not
in free decision, but in free necessity.
Let us, however, descend to created things,
which are all determined to exist and to act in fixed
and precise ways by outside causes. To see this
more clearly, let us imagine a very simple case. A

They were all pretty smart, and the opposition to new ideas actually had math and data (that were available at the time!) on its side. Kepler's model, for example, required a believe in gigantic stars (all starts are the size of Betelgeuse or even larger), based on data available at the time, which today we know was wrong. Somewhere else I read about Galileo, as far as I remember apparently his telescope was pretty bad and it wasn't that other astronomers refused to look through it, as our modern myth about their ""stupidity"" goes, but that what could be seen was not conclusive.

I mean many people may disagree with string theory, but it's hard for me to accept that it's science at all.

One example is the big bang theory being proposed by a Catholic astronomer who didn't like the then prevaling idea that the universe did not have a beginning or end because it went against his religious beliefs.

And most of you won’t be accepted, and of those who are, most won’t become professors even if you want to.I figured a physics degree would allow me to get a good job, but then they said, sure, if you want to do finance, defense, or education. What?! The first two were pretty nauseating so I decided to do a year-long internship at various local public schools, and realized that I hated that too.

I read American Prometheus a few years ago, which is the biography of him that’s really in depth and factually accurate. One note I thought was interesting was that Einstein was considered from a different generation of physicists and people looked at him differently.But the book compares Oppy’s contemporaries like Hans Beta to Oppy and reaches the same “no Einstein” conclusion. But my read was that that wasn’t a bad thing, Oppy was extremely capable in physics, but his real natural talent was in bringing out the true insights from others rather than making those insights himself directly, and was otherworldly good at coordination leadership. Which is why he led the Los Alamos project.I don’t think I view “no Einstein” as a dig, but rather a factual tr	constantly	7.1204367	-0.00700711	comment	4.0	12.0	1689931185	-1.0119739

And is clearly an attempt to connect to the transcendental, the divine, the unknowable, why are we here and what am I meant to do with myself, etc.Both of those pursuits are worthy of curiosity and respect. And astrology itself is an ancient practice, few traditions are that long-lived at all and certainly not without many people over much time finding value in them. I don't know anything about astrology and certainly don't practice it, but this easy satisfying dismissal of yours is childish imo.	giraffe_lady	7.062624	0.41726914	comment	4.0	20.0	1690156025	3.5774772

For whatever progress science makes, there’s this underlying primordial quality that often gets lost in the academic conceptual descriptions and labels assigned to this phenomena.I think it’s fair to say earth is alive with a completely straight face, and it’s probably even important for more people to start seeing it this way.	haswell	6.4370313	0.3999096	comment	4.0	20.0	1691539925	6.7386317

First, he was here at the right time. Relativity was begging to be discovered, at the time we had observations good enough to invalidate the previous theories and fit the new ones. The mathematical groundwork was here, all that was needed was a spark of genius, which Einstein had, but I'm quite many others had it too. But maybe the others chose a topic other than physics, had a different education, or were born too early or too late...Furthermore, Einstein essentially took 10 years to revolutionize physics. And then, not much. By not much, I mean he was still a top class physicist, but he couldn't restart the spark of genius, or he simply didn't have fu"	GuB-42	6.9964356	-0.047717057	comment	4.0	24.0	1600646792	-1.3254592

I also think it is extremely important to know whether low parental income causes mental disorders, and to have a good estimate of the effect size.So I read through this and of course down at the end we get:""It is important to note that rather than investigating the causal effect of parental income per se, we conceptualised parental income as an indicator for an array of measured and unmeasured monetary and non-monetary indices of family’s social environments that are typically interrelated. As our results indicate, controlling for a range of covariates attenuates the relative risk estimates observed, but such estimates would still only constitute"	dash2	7.19169	0.32759592	comment	4.0	14.0	1605965566	13.036603

To stay with the physics theme, the Schwarzschild solution of general relativity is a very special one and I don't think anybody thinks that black holes are gossip.And it is certainly not surprising that amateurs in general forget that F = ma is only valid if the mass does not change. The more general expression is F = dp/dt, where p is the momentum. But this, of course, is also only valid in inertial systems. It's not really important to the article but it does kind of annoy me that he uses the most special case of an expression in an argument about it being general.He could have actually made the point about generality by comparing this expression to the most general one for the force (in a fr	QuantumRoar	6.5084753	-0.0706656	comment	4.0	14.0	1505294807	3.2887852

The opposite is true. There is no first moment of time, just as there is no smallest positive number. In physics we have equations and laws of nature that describe how one situation changes into another, but we have no equations that show how true nothingness turns into somethingness. So, since the universe did not spring into existence, it has always existed, though perhaps not in its current form.Or the equations are only approximations that hold under certain conditions?	zibby8	6.5372305	-0.146003	comment	4.0	43.0	1662944191	-7.2122564

My research was on understanding the mechanism of enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation reactions. This is very detailed physical-organic reaction kinetics to seek to understand the basis for some of the remarkable acceleration that the enzyme provides (10^6) over model systems in aqueous solution.Reflecting on this, I find it sad that I never really saw how to place this research into the much broader biological context in which it exists.

Looking for patterns and then figuring out causality later is a great way to solve real-world problems. Of course you can be led astray if your filters are too open, but if your work is rigorous and you still come out with a 6-sigma correlation then congratulations, you found a signal. What does it mean? How does it work? Who cares, there's plenty of time to figure that out. But in the meantime you can hypothesize that the connection exists, monitor it for a year or two, and if the correlation holds up and turns out to have some predictive value, then a winner is you.	anigbrowl	7.150892	0.055289824	comment	4.0	20.0	1686959595	13.024148

I'm also puzzled at the widespread view that by removing the SAT some grave injustice or lowering in standards is inevitable. Canadian universities manage to admit students mostly just based on high school grades just fine. (Yes, there are provincial final exams but those scores often are not available for admissions since they're taken in the 12th grade). The SAT itself was an odd exam for me, unlike anything I ever had to take in Canada. The SAT IIs (and AP/IB exams) on the other hand seemed like they assessed things more reasonably. The SAT's heritage as a poor attempt at an IQ test which then morphed into whatever the heck it is today, makes its utility somewhat out	contemporary343	7.4921675	1.0789863	comment	4.0	15.0	1592283164	-2.0933762

The highest score goes not to the person who thinks critically but to the one who gamed the system the most.  If you can teach someone to win at candy-crush, you can get them to ace the SAT's.Some of the most important people in society have not typically done well in structured schooling, and this is in part because a lot of education is bs in the first place.

You could replace the SAT and ACT with obscure movie trivia and you’d see roughly the same distribution of scores and it would have the same predictive power. The people who signal that they’re willing to put it a lot of time, money, and effort into their education do well… surprised pikachu.There’s no such thing as qualified for college outside of a genuine desire and motivation to do it.So I don’t see any sort of contradiction in colleges admitting people based on novelty, coolness, and straight-up effort.

The visual readability of an opaque non-reflective cube is always going to be higher than that of a mirror cube in a non studio environment.This is because your brain needs to do more legwork to figure out the underlying shape when you look at reflective suefaces that are mostly flat and show you parts of a sky that you may or may not see at that point.Reflectivity can also work in your favour, to highlight shapes, especially when the paint additionally has a diffuse color (think of cars) and they are in eye level (less confusing sky reflections), but highly reflective glass buildings with nothing else to gisually hold on will most of the time just reflect "	atoav	6.467344	0.001416266	comment	4.0	16.0	1564989237	7.134487

He is seeing the p-value as a random variable that can take values from 0 to 1 and follows some distribution. Under these hypotheses, observing a p-value of 0.20 and 0.005 is completely reasonable even if unlikely. Those are just two draws from a random variable.Edit. Under Bayesian statistics testing the null hypothesis is a moot point as it becomes possible to directly model the distribution of the possible effects.

That's simple and actionable and is an immediate consequence of the definition of p-values! Frankly, I don't know why text-books don't give this as the definition of p-values, and they should reserve ""probability of an event at least as extreme conditional upon the null hypothesis"" as the thing-you-show-to-prove-it's-a-p-value.The current trend of saying that ""cutting p-values off at a specific value is bad"" makes me worry.

You can't build astronomy on a foundation of astrology.  Using Babylonian base-60 mathematics won't help you create a unified field theory.  The guy who showed me some random velocity that he had picked, and taken c^2 divided by that velocity, had not shown that faster-than-light travel was possible.It's like cargo-cult physics.  They (try to) do all the things, but the starting point is wrong, so it can't work.So showing them ""where to even begin"" is in fact the solution... if they'll listen."

General relativity was then developed on a purely theoretical basis.That it was able to explain Mercury's orbit was a nice bit of empirical confirmation after the theory was developed. Having such evidence probably helped get the theory accepted faster; but probably wasn't necessary. Almost by definition, a theory that is ultimately useful can be confirmed without need of astronomy.

Thus far, it behaves exactly as expected according to the standard model and that is very dull.HEP would have been left in a very funny position if we didn't find it.

Better schools can easily bump students up 2 or 3 grades compared to poorer schools. To some extent this will also improve students’ ability to complete degree courses, but there’s also a great extent to which this is just teaching students how to pass standardised tests well. It’s true that truly excellent students will do well regardless of school, but you’ll end up with mostly average students from good schools.Universities in the UK use A-level results (which are mostly based on standardised tests), but will sometimes compensate (lower) the required grade based on a students school and background.

We should then try to understand differences in metaphysical claims by finding differences in logics.The author then tries to show this for the metaphysical claim, 'Statements are true or false independent of whether they can be verified.' Instead of arguing about what is truth, what does it mean for a proposition to be verified. We can instead as about the differences in the logic.

In a field where even core studies don't tend to get replicated (this is changing slowly and grudgingly), it has survived decades of replication and attacks.Given the political self identification of the professors in the field (over 99% progressive), it seems reasonable to assume that the political beliefs of the faculty contribute to the skepticism that the field, and academia more broadly, have of IQ.	nordsieck	7.477363	0.7892799	comment	5.0	37.0	1557250497	-3.9350924

Similar remarks were made in 1993 about Mandela and De Klerk. It can even be argued that Gorbachev and Carter had blood on their hands before becoming saints.Maybe this kind of ambiguity is simply rooted in the fact that the monetary price is paid by the deeply ironic invention of dynamite by Alfred Nobel.'

It was perfect - it tested both knowledge and critical thinking skills and experimental design. It was obscure so no material was available for specific training.In the end the scores were so accurate in predicting eventual success - a decade later, the folks who got 96% plus are all either professors or deliberately chose not to, while the rest just took industry jobs (and in my opinion because they realized that’s best for them).Here’s the kicker - every institution explicitly said they will NOT consider these scores as part of admission process.

Since there's no a priori reason why life should prefer either left handed or right handed molecules, the way we got here is the result of the first proto-metabolic processes billions of years ago just happening to choose what we use today.  If we introduced mirror image microorganisms into the ecosystem, the danger is they could outcompete existing organisms while simultaneously contaminating the environment with their mirror-image waste products.	actually_a_dog	6.567833	0.19533306	comment	5.0	17.0	1667501312	-6.69107

Dark matter, dark energy -- as far as I know, everyone working on them see our current ideas as placeholders until someone comes up with a good explanation.Sure, there are many examples of scientists clinging on to old ideas too long, but eventually when enough evidence is marshaled by someone to overturn the old model, they are heralded and giv	tasty_freeze	6.8625746	-0.08777164	comment	5.0	18.0	1669524101	-3.166296

It's good to keep in mind that even the most transformative thinkers in the history of science had reasons to experience impostor syndrome. Einstein famously had a lot of trouble with math as well.No matter how good you are, physics will regularly present you with problems that you can't solve. Statistically speaking, most of the time spent doing science is spent being wrong. As soon as you figure a system out your work is essentially done and you move on to being wrong about a different problem. The psychology is very different from working problem sets, writing an app, or defending a political position, yet we don't really prepare students for these realities as we probably should.	yummypaint	7.4030085	-0.068510376	comment	5.0	23.0	1670526379	0.9691693

If you know I scored INTP on my last test, am I equally likely to score say ESFJ on a subsequent test as opposed to INTP or something closer to it (there are four dimensions after all) than a randomly selected person? Nope.If I ask you what your weight and height is today, it's indicative of what your weight and height will be a year from now even if the number doesn't fit into exactly the same rounded range.

12979884	Up until college, I had always heard	Up until college, I had always heard the story of the Catholic Church persecuting Galileo as sort of the prototypical example of the church's attitude toward science.  As a Catholic, I figured it was an episode where Galileo was clearly in the right and the Church was clearly in the wrong.In college, though, I discovered that many influential Catholics strongly reject the idea that Galileo was persecuted by the Catholic Church because the Church disagreed with his theory or felt it threatened to undermine its teachings:http://www.catholic.com/tracts/the-galileo-controversytl;dr - It's more complicated than the typical anti-Catholic narrative suggests.  The episode was primarily a clash of personalities (Galileo was a jerk and insulted thin-skinned Vatican officials who misused their power 	jawns	7.4162297	0.46892697	comment	5.0	63.0	1479406608	0.20435724
12980690	Except the thing is, Galileo's model	Except the thing is, Galileo's model was not supported by science. They had neither a proper theoretical model for deriving it (Newton's and Kepler's work on gravity and celestial movement, which came after Galileo), nor did the Galileo's model agree with available observational data. From the point of view of scientists of that age, his model was more like a crackpot theory. Which turned out ok, but only much later.So if anything, Galileo's story is about the Church being on the side of science, not against it.

Because until evolutionists can fully explain and demonstrate how and why the above don't contradict with the current model, evolution theory also reduces to metaphysics.You can't claim that your theory is ""proven"" when there are aspects of biology that don't fit with your theory.

In that case, the birds should actively be as loud as possible and make their presence known to the lumberjack.Both models are perfectly logical, but come to opposite conclusions--we simply have no idea whether aliens are more like the predators of the dark forest or the lumberjack.As for Hanson's theory, it might be that the universe is one giant winner	Gunax	6.3697486	0.4015179	comment	5.0	36.0	1616083790	7.0412984

A: Any given couple could potentially have several eggs fertilized in the lab with the dad’s sperm and the mom’s eggs. Then you can test multiple embryos and analyze which one’s going to be the smartest. That kid would belong to that couple as if they had it naturally, but it would be the smartest a couple would be able to produce if they had 100 kids. It’s not genetic engineering or adding new genes, it’s the genes that couples already have.Q: And over the course of several generations you’re able to exponentially multiply the population’s intelligence.

If we move s_1 + epsilon increases E_1 by epsilon * |X_lt| and decreases E_1 by epsilon * |X_gt|, this implies that E_1 is minimized when the number of elements of X on either side of s_1 is equal (now that I've written this out I think that's what 'ogogmad is getting at).I'm still trying to develop the intuition for why minimizing E_2 implies taking the mean.	andreareina	7.48914	0.18612595	comment	5.0	24.0	1594465333	-0.13312387

But some hard SF writers like Baxter also imagined life based on electromagnetic interactions, nuclear reactions (life in the mantle of a neutron star), fluid vortices and turbulences (life in liquid or gaseous planets), etc. Basically he included a lot of substrates that could be used to implement complexity.Also, a big drawback of searching only chemistry-based life is that it limits a lot the range of viable temperatures. Would be too slow and simplistic at low temperatures, and a complete uncontrollable chaos at high temperatures.In particular, finding a brine on an ice dwarf like Ceres is not very exciting, as the temperature is too low, and no interesting chemistry can happen.Whereas other substrates coul	henearkr	6.4029794	0.3513011	comment	5.0	26.0	1597112826	7.1113925

Therefore if you're happy with space not existing prior to the big bang (which people do seem to be OK with) then automatically time didn't exist either, and hence 'before the big bang' ceases to be a problem.	onion2k	6.4996386	-0.03249363	comment	5.0	31.0	1597927018	-5.5580664

Scores should be reproducible. I've yet to see an IQ test that didn't test skills you could improve by practicing.They also assume knowledge. For example, the IQ test I had when I was young included word comparisons. This tested vocabulary more than intelligence. Someone who didn't have a formal education or didn't know English well would score lower regardless of their intelligence.IQ is not highly regarded in psychology. It's more reliable than garbage like Meyers-Briggs but is not a true test of intelligence.	driverdan	7.444029	0.7321109	comment	5.0	15.0	1558550837	-4.0645046

I was handed an IQ test circa ~1996 and got about two thirds through it before I found a question where none of the responses were correct.  I brought it to the teacher’s attention.  “There is no way you could possibly be right, this test was reviewed first!”Anyway, blame it on photocopy errors or whatever, but the answers were wrong.  Still mad about it.I took another one ~2007 when I was looking to be a marketing person for a construction equipment rental company.  This one was about 30 questions over 60 minutes.

But fundamentally there weren't as different from me as some other people I knew. I was wishing for an alien that thought completely differently - different morals, different logic, different cultural blind spots and esthetics.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb himself can see the value at the lower levels.If the goal was to find people that can, say, program, I think IQ works as a perfectly fine metric.

36847151	Increased interest in astrology has 	Increased interest in astrology has been noted before in societies with declining traditional religious belief and greater feelings of uncertainty. Whereas a Christian would leave his concerns about things out of his control with God, and a stoic might simply accept his powerlessness, the anxious remainder look for other ways of trying to cope. Astrology has a track record of filling this void with its fatalism, and like all occult practices, it does so by luring people with irrational promises of foreknowledge, control, and power.	lo_zamoyski	7.166592	0.47824147	comment	5.0	21.0	1690203003	3.4935813

25202448	Related to this, one of my favourite	Related to this, one of my favourite articles [1] suggests that it’s sufficient to only use one or two pieces of memory to get good estimates. Here’s a pretty amazing result from the paper. To estimate the median (loosely) on a stream, first set the median estimate m to 0 prior to seeing any data. Then as you observe the stream, increase the median estimate m by 1 if the current element s is bigger than m. Do nothing if the current element is the same as m. Decrease the estimate by 1 if the element is less than m. Then (given the right conditions) this process converges to the median.

While in reality A causes B, just there are C, D, ..., Z, and some of them also causes B, others works other way and cancel some of others. And some of them works only when Moon is in the right phase.p<0.01 is good when we have a good model of reality which generally works. When we have no good model, there are no good value for p.

You're willing to risk tens of thousands of dollars more money for some risk insurance.I have such a hard time accepting that people can't just teach themselves things using free online resources. It's been shown in many studies that self directed learning doesn't work, but it worked for me.

Most of the insights seem pretty obvious. Like if you're working from the point of correlating totals across differently sized legs of an experiment, you're starting from a really bad place.Personally, I'm not quite positive that I buy that causation is that hard to establish in many cases. Don't give up on that idea. One thing I would say is that if you have a strong prior reason to believe that one thing causes another thing, finding that they are strongly correlated, that can be a useful datum. Mainly the important thing is to understand the limitations of correlation to guide decisionmaking.	asdfasgasdgasdg	7.093766	0.097486444	comment	6.0	28.0	1630099637	13.050003

26650345	Intelligent Design as a theory for l	Intelligent Design as a theory for life’s origins has received a lot of unfair criticism because people think it’s code for “young earth creationism”. It’s not though, it’s an observation that random natural processes are too slow at generating information to be responsible for life on earth.It’s the same deductive logic you would use if you found an artifact in the middle of the desert. Yes natural forces could have carved an image from the rock, but the more detailed the image the less likely it arose naturally.The fact that even now, no one has any idea of how to create the basic forms of life shows the astonishing amount of information that exists in even a simple cell. It’s time to reconsider intelligent design, even if the designer is an alien species or a programmer of a simulation.	camjohnson26	6.7588663	0.30297992	comment	6.0	50.0	1617212316	6.356836

The variance in IQ between modern whites and whites 100 years ago is significantly higher than any measurable difference between whites and blacks today. In addition to this, the IQ of blacks is rising at a faster rate than the IQ of whites, and seems to be approaching convergence. Looking at changes over time, it seems that average IQ in large population groups is mostly a function of culture rather than genetics.

Now, it is seen as an extension of high school; the onus is on the college to mold all comers into more educated and productive citizens, even if that means re-teaching the basics.[1998] http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/28/local/me-54085>The Times reported in March on data from the California State University system showing that roughly half of the freshmen at the Fullerton campus failed basic-skills placement exams and had to enroll in remedial math and English courses.

It would better be described as a phenomenology[1]. I'm sure many will disagree with this factually more accurate description, because of the emotional role their ideation of science plays in their lives, but I believe it has greater intellectual utility and that a phenomenology can even be of greater value than an experimental science.

Heck the SAT has even been renamed as they don’t want to be affiliated with anything resembling IQ any more.The heritability of IQ is only well established within true believers of a pseudo-science tightly linked with the eugenics movement. Most psychologists today believe that the supposed heritability was observed because of bias within the research.

A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed. Another way to speed reactions up is to heat them, but that consumes energy and often leads to by-products that must be removed and disposed of.The ""asymmetric"" part has to do with one kind of by-product. Some reactions produce 50% of a by-product that must be separated out and disposed of. This happens because some molecules have 3D structure that's different than its mirror image. Think of the way that certain objects like bottle caps and screws only turn one way to tighten. Molecules can have that property (including many drugs you may have taken), and if the handedness is wrong, in many applications, it's a by-product "	aazaa	7.2286506	0.357691	comment	6.0	47.0	1633526285	4.6866217

When people know the Earth is round because they actually understand the physics behind it, there's no way you're ever going to convince them the Earth is flat.Instead of admitting our education system has failed, people's ignorance is being used as an excuse to tighten control over the	calibas	6.784795	0.3339317	comment	6.0	33.0	1606663480	-6.8117094

Punishing people for being less prepared than peers who did more practice or for making ordinary and expected mistakes actively gets in the way of their learning, as well as making them feel terrible. It's pretty bad for the students who are more prepared as well, as many of them internalize the idea that they are inherently good at some things and inherently bad at others, which is sometimes temporarily gratifying but often stops them from pushing themselves to try anything new or hard.	jacobolus	7.54994	0.9235907	comment	6.0	43.0	1703655222	-2.0814278

One person might find it easy to model mathematical theorems, others the internal working of car engines.

Even when we think about potentially highly advanced aliens, we still assume they'll have a psychology similar to ours, and they'll just be more advanced technologically (ie. the aliens and ants analogy).Eventually, I did find some cases in Science Fiction, and one in particular stands out as far as I am concerned: the alien entity named Rorschach and the smaller entities named Scramblers, in Firefall, by Peter Watts.

Also, the IQ score itself was normalized to be normally distributed centered at 100.With this understanding, I was under the impression that IQ was a relative measure, at a specific point in time, of one's placement in the distribution.Which meant to me that IQ cannot ""drop"" across a population, the mean will always be 100.

In senior year any of these people can take AP Statistics or Calculus AB, but only the advanced track can take AP Calculus BC.So anyway the point is Berkeley has always done math the ""reform"" way and its math outcomes are much better in every respect.

You have to pick carefully. Moreover, if you look at the history of philosophy that has always been the case, although the percentage of trash might have increased a little bit lately due to the nature of peer reviewing and the overall state of the discipline 	JohnStrange	7.4232078	0.10221388	comment	7.0	58.0	1481894881	3.8151681

Personality is a much worse predictor on highly g-loaded tasks, and a good predictor on some others (e.g. wages). But (IQ, personality) pairs are an even better predictor than IQ or personality.The only way you can draw the conclusion that IQ doesn't matter much is if you compare to predictors of the form (IQ, personality, achievement, grades) (and a few similar ones). Shockingly, using achievement to predict achievement yields a more accurate predictor than using (IQ, personality).(I really do not understand this paper's methodology of graphing r^2 values.

The authors of _Grading For Equity_ spoke at my school and the reasoning they gave for eliminating 0-grading (i.e., not using 0 as the lowest possible grade) was because it's basically impossible to recover from. Ideally, a student who masters the material by the end of class should get the same grade as one who masters it at the beginning; being fast or slow shouldn't factor into your grade, but with 0-grading, like you say, an early test or assignment can tank your final grade, even if your knowledge eventually catches up to what it should be.	professoretc	7.5502048	0.9923443	comment	7.0	21.0	1624122256	-1.9612441

In fact, the highest grade was a ""C"" obtained by the class genius. I studied hard for the exam, attended all lectures, did all homework assignments, and got a ~45 on the exam out of 100 points. At that point, you have nothing like a bell curve. The teacher has failed to either teach or formulate a test that meets reasonable expectations. Something is broken.

That's because central bank adjusts interest rates to counter other variables so that inflation remains near the target.Other example (my favorite, it was mindblowing when my teacher showed it to us on econometrics as a warning :) ) - gas pedal and speed of a car driving on a hilly road. Driver wants to drive near the speed limit, so he adjusts the gas pedal to keep the speed constant. Simplistic conclusion would be - speed is constant despite the gas pedal position changing therefore they are unrelated :)	ajuc	7.128456	0.19105674	comment	7.0	34.0	1556787516	13.037333

He imagines literally every for-profit corporation, the military, and the entire federal government as being one fused united party with identical interests, and so NBCUniversal would never report anything critical of the military or the US government.

I have graduated from one of the top physics/maths high schools in Russia, and yes we had great math education there, but that was an outlier. Outside a handful of schools the math education is pretty dismal.
And even in the good math schools there are different ways of teaching maths. I.e. there is a famous system of 'sheets' where the actual teaching of formal theory is very limited, while most of learning is done by solving problems (given to you on a sheet) and then presenting solutions to the teacher.

This results in children who have higher aptitudes[1] to not be well served by schools. The majority of people I know who have the means opt out of the public school system, which probably makes the problem worse generally but solves a pain point for them.[1] - I take it as a fact that different people have different talent levels for different things, but not everyone agrees with that, and disagreement on this point is a big driver (but not the only driver) in the ""everyone gets exactly the same"" approach that is trending now."	idoh	7.49248	0.89644563	comment	7.0	53.0	1650999098	-1.6061628

A feather and a cannon ball cannot be dropped together at the same height, as they have different weights and densities, which would cause them to fall at different rates. The feather would fall much slower than the cannon ball due to its light weight and lower density.
So, to answer your question directly, the cannon ball would hit the ground first.

It shows the person doesn't even try to connect cause and effect in a meaningful way, and in astrology this is all there is to it. No epistemology. No logic.

This circuit is awfully complex....    it's possible to do the same with a far simpler circuit if you use the same coil for sensing and accelerating the ball.A small microcontroller could do both - perhaps even with low enough power that the whole circuit could stay turned on for years on a charge (when not flinging the ball).Looking at the total energy you need to impart on the ball, you should be able to do that with a far smaller coil and many fewer capacitors as long as you have a suitably shaped steel core to keep the flux path low.   I suspect you might be able to do it with no capacitors at all, since modern lithium cells are perfectly happy to deliver 100 amps for a few milliseconds.	londons_explore	6.574532	0.26374066	comment	7.0	26.0	1694722774	4.5682573

Since the universe can't cause itself, its cause must be outside of the universe. It must be immaterial; not made up of the stuff of the universe.

The gist is that a self-replicating RNA sequence would have to be at least 40 nucleotides (and possibly even as long as 100), but the probability of randomly synthesizing a 40-nucleotide long sequence that happens to be self-replicating anywhere in the visible universe over the span of 13 billion years is effectively zero.To be fair, the probability gets closer to one if you expand your view to include the entire universe and assume that it is many, many orders of magnitude larger than the visible uni"	Calavar	6.490866	0.46201605	comment	7.0	25.0	1659111241	6.524949

For instance, if we use the standard definition of a square, then every square you will ever encounter will necessarily have four sides.  In contrast, not every square you encounter will be blue or tiny. Those are contingent properties of a square. A square may be blue, or it may not be. A square may be tiny, or it may not be.Now, would you say that our universe's existence is necessary or contingent?

It's deeply valuable, but there is no instance of any kind of nothing that actually exists. There is only ""exists"". The most basic form of existence is change. Even if there had been nothing, and something came from it, in order for something to come from it, there would first need to have been some change. So regardless of how it could have started, change has to be the first thing. But in my opinion, recursive cycles is a more likely explanation than a linear universe with a start and end that are both in 'nothing'.

They aren't there to teach 'how science works' except in the most rudimentary sense, and its hard for me to think science education would be improved by removing core material in favor of a discussion of the peer review process!The author's suggestion might be appropriate for social studies, or a a special, AP level class where logical positivism, Karl popper, and Kuhn might be discussed.I refer the interested reader here to:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2975230-scientifi	avsteele	7.5177016	0.06874124	comment	8.0	37.0	1614692696	-0.81006664

Overheating has happened before, of course, however the method of overheating is unique - the inhabitants invented a method of identifying uniqueness by making large calculations and attaching small drawings to the calculations, they then proceeded to trade these tokens as something of value, using more and more energy and creating a runaway green house effect. This has been used as an example to disprove the existence of god.	chadcmulligan	6.440274	0.26488945	comment	8.0	96.0	1615095321	4.96892

35518164	When IQ tests were invented folks di	When IQ tests were invented folks didn't know about tests, at least in the US. They were rural immigrants who could maybe read. So when asked logic questions, they would answer pragmatically and be 'wrong'. That had some impact on perceived early low results.As folks became better-read and educated they began to understand that IQ test questions were a sort of puzzle, not a real honest question. The answer was expected to solve the puzzle, not be right in any way.E.g. There are no Elephants in Germany. Munich is in Germany. How many elephants are there in Munich?  A) 0  B) 1  C)2Folks back then might answer B or C, because they figure hey there's probably a zoo in Munich, bet they have an elephant or two there. And be marked wrong.

Oral exams need much more time from competent evaluators than written exams do, and those evaluators need to be paid for their time. The vast majority of universities these days are going to prioritize cost-reduction over quality of education if they can get away with it, and they probably can.	bhaney	7.5382986	0.6886768	comment	8.0	46.0	1681925416	12.574578

The study found that the school aged children of African American servicemen in Germany had the same average IQ as their classmates.Something we're doing to large numbers of urban children in the US is morally equivalent to putting lead in the water. It's largely been the political left in the US which has had control of large urban areas. The culture of the US in the 1st half of the 20th century wasn't harmful in this way. Poles and Italians were able to increase their average IQ's to parity with the US as a whole in that period.

We are trying to look very carefully at Nature because we don't think we have the whole story.It is possible that Einstein is exactly right.

From reading their executive summary, the CEBR researchers seem to take the global value added (GVA) of any physics-based industry, and consider it as a something like a contribution of physics to the society.
That sounds like a gross overestimation to me.As an example, they consider ""Extraction of crude petroleum"" as a physics-based industry. Naively I would consider that industry at least 33% physics, 33% chemistry, and 33% engineering.

How do you live your life your last three days?One school of thought says, disregard the evidence. Assert, against it all, that the meteor is going to miss. Or if that's hard, decide to trust someone who asserts it (this is usually easier).This is arguably rational. If you're wrong, it won't matter, and you'll probably feel less awful your last three days.I think creationist's thinking is something like this:1. If evolution is true, then God is not.

Clever groups are starting to wise up to this and have dedicated programmers supporting astronomers, rather than assuming that the computer is just a glorified calculator that everyone needs to be able to use.For the record I am a numerical astrophysicist and I read and write plenty of bad code every day.

Am I wrong in saying that?

No, I didn't actually believe the earth was flat, but I loved the outrage it provoked and the attention I got when I told people I was a flat earther. I also enjoyed trying to defend my position and call out (valid) logical fallacies round earthers were making. It really forces you to improve your debate skills when you have to defend an impossible position. Lastly, there was a social aspect of it, a camaraderie with other flat earthers that made me feel like I belonged to a ""secret"" organization that was fun and influential. I eventually outgrew that hobby.I'm sure there are many ""genuine"" flat earthers, but I suspect there are a lot of flat earthers like me as well.

The team then sent their samples to IBM laboratories in Zurich, Switzerland, where collaborators put the oxygen–carbon molecules on a layer of sodium chloride, inside a high-vacuum chamber. They manipulated the rings one at a time with electric currents (using an atomic-force microscope that can also act as a scanning-transmission microscope), to remove the extraneous, oxygen-containing parts.

Other forms of intelligence?More specifically, there are two things that bother me with the way we usually look at intelligence: time scale, and individuality.To assess intelligence, we often look at individuals, not at the group. And we tend to do it on our own time scales. But I wouldn't be surprised if the ""individual"" you have to assess is the ant colony, not the ants themselves. And who is to say that rocks aren't smart? Have you observed them over hundreds of millennia? (I'm just kidding about the last one, though the question is still theoretically valid)."

23736364	As much as we talk about math litera	As much as we talk about math literacy here (compared to other platforms anyway), I can't help but feel like the incomprehensibility of high level math to laymen is a feature. It's not talked about outside of academia often, because why would it be, but for a long time philosophy resisted efforts to 'mathmatecize' (my own word) the field because of concern that it would become inscrutible to outsiders. As a result, academic philosophy is much more politically polarized than math. Where would we be if every step forward in mathematics was met with backlash for not paying adequate concern to some arbitrary set of external implications? Anyone can disagree of course but just looking at the political affiliation ratios of educators makes it clear that one aspect of the hard sciences historical	37r7u43urr	7.358383	-0.12954642	comment	10.0	74.0	1593919247	0.37621918

The denial of a natural teleology (i.e., denying that a purpose, goal, or reason underlies the universe and Nature) was a useful conceptual bridge when scientific materialism was founded and growing - it allowed the burden of highly-politicized organized religion to be shrugged off and for many previously-untouchable classes of questions to be explored in new (read: empirical) ways. However, the utter rejection of a telos during that transition period (by the engineering class in particular) was, I believe, too thorough; to this day, the default position of many working scientists and engineers is that Nature has no purpose, goal, or reason whatsoever.

A lot of introspection needs to be done to determine why these decisions were made. At the time of the decision, the admissions committees claimed the exact opposite was true, that the tests are poor predictors and disadvantaged already-disadvantaged students. Now they're claiming the opposite. Based on what data? Why did we allow the admissions committees of so-called 'elite' institutions to be so easily swayed? Are these institutions really worthy of their 'elite' status? It would seem to be called into question if they can't answer a question as straightforwards as this.Especially institutions like MIT... one would expect that they have a solid understanding of data an	anon291	7.492316	1.0288436	comment	10.0	54.0	1708614383	-2.2415798

The testing center in downtown SF had no windows, a metal detector, and you had to check all food outside of the testing room. Just in case you were going to try to cheat off of your banana. I think each computer was also recording a video of you taking the test although I might be mistaken here. Certainly there were cameras set up all around the perimeter.I'm shocked at how laissez-faire we've gotten for college entrance exams, which I'd arguably say are much more important at getting you _into_ the graduate programs than the actual graduate program exams are themselves.	icyfox	7.5037684	0.8713074	comment	10.0	118.0	1709748733	-2.2429771

And this news... it's exciting in the sense that it's an important result, but it's a bit of a damper on those of us who were hoping to discover new secrets about the universe.Interestingly, the primary production mechanism for the Higgs boson at the LHC proceeds via the fusion of gluon particles from the colliding protons. This seems strange at first glance, since the Higgs interacts with particles proportionally to their mass, while the gluons are massless. In the standard model, there is a higher-order process wherein the gluons annihilate into a virtual ""loop"" of top quarks (which are very massive), which then ""lend"" their mass to produce the Higgs.Because prev"	cshimmin	6.551054	-0.08529613	comment	10.0	113.0	1528187899	14.034725

Human knowledge has gaps because humans do not live long enough to effectively pass enough knowledge from generation to generation.

However, since the overlap between two generation's cognitive prime age is narrow, not every thought, intuition, idea is passed along well enough. This creates a continuous rot in knowledge among generations and hence the humanity causing perpetual gaps in knowledge.This is the main reason why humanity at large does not have perfect knowledge of things such as universal forces, exact nature of universe, ability to predict random events and so on."	ketanmaheshwari	7.388682	0.1288356	comment	11.0	43.0	1594602718	2.3435998

The problem is that only publishing significant results is a bias against the null hypothesis.Let's say you're doing a study of flipping coins. The null hypothesis is that the coin is evenly weighted. If the null hypothesis is true, when you flip a coin once, it will come up heads with P=.5. If you flip the coin twice, the null hypothesis is that both flips come up heads with P=.25. The probability of all coins coming up heads is P=0.125 for 3 flips, P=0.0625 for 4 flips, and P=.03125 for 5 flips.

Unfortunately, rich applicants can also pay to boost whatever other signal is used by the admissions committee. Extracurriculars? Those violin lessons didn't pay for themselves! High School internship? Consider which families have the connections to find those opportunities. And now research papers...I actually think standardized test scores are considerably less subject to bias than anything else!IMO, the only actual solution is to specifically consider socioeconomic background as part of the admissions process.

They were then asked to go back and pick the place where the laser was when they observed the change. The study found that people remembered clicking the button 10ms (or some other tiny value) before they actually did. This was clearly grounds for all of us to question whether humans had free will at all, because the result was statistically significant after all! When I challenged the professor on this, I was told that I should take a statistics class.

Completing it would take hours.  Far behind, they could not multiply at age 8 "	thebiss	7.403515	0.04863013	comment	11.0	47.0	1626726540	0.51080376

From a 'test system' design perspective:- You'd want it to be somewhere isolated to avoid casualties, especially if there was a radiation risk (which you wouldn't know).- You wouldn't want people to be able to analyze the immediate wreckage with any kind of high fidelity because there might be signatures of whatever you sent back (or however you sent it) that might change the course of history/technology.- You'd want there to be fairly detailed recordings (ideally photos), and for it to persist into modern history, not just be a weird anomaly of 'the past'.- You wouldn't want it be interpreted as some kind of milit	alexholehouse	6.4952164	0.6412871	comment	11.0	92.0	1468086673	6.6744447

As a physicist I’d estimate 99.9% of her colleagues would disagree and I would too. She has no real argument, just vaguely gestures at “maybe the comoving frame makes relativity invalid” and then vaguely gestures at “quantum gravity spoiling everything we know so far about physics”.As to the second point, quantum gravity is a thing but almost certainly will not upend the special relativistic account of the large scale causal ordering of events. This is for the same reason that it almost certainly won’t change the calculation of the amount of time it takes an apple to drop from a tree —- within the domain of validity of the old theory, its predictions will 	superposeur	6.409218	-0.121421434	comment	11.0	82.0	1681079930	7.076017

The question was basically, ""Find the median of a huge data set without sorting it,"" and the ""correct"" answer was to have a fixed size sorted buffer and randomly evict items from it and then use the median of the buffer. However, a candidate I was interviewing had a really brilliant insight: if we estimate the median and move it a small amount for each new data point, it would be pretty close.

No it doesn't, it has a long, long list of wrong answers, and a short list of answers that haven't yet been proven wrong, which makes up our current best approximation of 'the truth'.

So for example, even if tarot doesn't give you supernatural insight, the discussion it generates with the card reader may allow you to recognize insights that you otherwise would have missed.Or perhaps practices like this provide value by prompting people to make changes that they otherwise wouldn't have. For example, suppose someone who normally lacks confidence receives a prediction that they will soon find love, prompted by the prediction they decide to talk to someone they normally wouldn't and end up datin	harimau777	7.4736404	0.40571323	comment	12.0	75.0	1690203002	3.4194553

There is no way to observe that the world would behave differently whether or not the theory is true. If that's so, I can't think what point there is discussing it, except as a mental exercise. If you can't test a theory, that means it can't affect anything. I.e. it has no practical use, except as a form of entertainment.I would almost argue that it doesn't make sense to talk about something being true or untrue if it cannot be tested nor used to make any predictions. The whole concept of truth, for me, reflects the extent to which reality conforms to belief.

Our Standard Model predicts that these forces become more unified at higher energy levels:1. Electromagnetism merges with weak nuclear force at 246 GeV2. Electroweak force merges with strong nuclear force at around ~10^16 GeV ('grand unification')3.

To me, it isn't necessary for every research to have social relevance.Also, I thought climate change was pretty much a problem of social coordination. What exactly do we gain from building better model of climate change? Knowing where it's going to hit us hard? I supposed that could be useful, but even more pressing was how to motivate the people of Earth to make the necessary changes.Also, the money offered doesn't seem that huge on scale of countries. 1 billion dollars per year for operating cost?

Think of intelligence as a force multiplier, if you apply it to a bad person they become a terrible person. It would be disastrous to start genetic engineering for intelligence prior to tackling the ethics problem.The biggest issue with better ethics is that we can't define them, so we couldn't optimize for them.

Or maybe the stars aligned just right and both would have been fine if they hadn’t been doing it at the exact same time?I can’t help but feel like anybody who has found the “root cause” for any problem, their answer will reflect their biases far more than will reflect true causality.

Then when people get funding to look into these frontiers/gaps, and find that everything looks the same, they adjust their theories to push them out into the gaps.That's not Science, she emphatically states.For myself it sounds like saying, ""well you don't know Unicorns don't exist because we haven't looked everywhere, what if they're in <unexp"	hinkley	6.919303	-0.050289992	comment	13.0	88.0	1678119703	-5.8943744

As a short rebuttal, I feel as though many of those who tout Myers-Briggs as a comprehensive personality test fail to understand what the Myers-Briggs attempts to identify. While the ""value-add"" is more subjective, I'm going to go ahead and say it's not as useless as this article claims. While I don't think anyone (especially employers) should rely heavily on Myers-Briggs, I think it can provide a decent framework (or starting point) outlining basic facets of an individual's personality based on their own perspective. Though I often distrust individual claims about belonging a certain type, given my interest in understanding myself and facets of my own personality, I enjoy discussing why "	n-exploit	7.3900704	0.59739774	comment	13.0	140.0	1476195655	-8.486597

And the fact that there is a huge corpus of evidence out there in the world called ""life"" proving some of the possibilities already gives me hope that while we may never have FTL, the future could still be pretty wild."	jeremycw	6.3658442	0.18745883	comment	13.0	96.0	1629210460	7.1062455

But I do wonder to what extent his views are based on a possibly over-optimistic view of the world's potential, and a refusal or inability to accept that the the universe might be fundamentally unjust and that life is not always dignified or sacred. I would like to share his hopeful outlook (hopeful in the sense that he seems to think there ought to be a counterfactual world where everyone behaves decently towards each other and the planet), but it seems to me that it is in the nature of life to want power, and it is in the nature of power to control anything that threatens it, and so conflict, struggle and might making right are intrinsic (but perhaps deplorable) features of the world.	dotsam	7.217715	0.023974944	comment	13.0	53.0	1632654178	-12.314822

Anything going that fast should be energetic enough to interact with the cosmic microwave background, which is hugely blueshifted in its frame of reference. The GZK is a kind of cosmic speed limit over long distances.So anything this energetic would need have a nearby source (in astrophysical terms) so it doesn't have time to slow down. But when we trace these things back, we see bupkus in the direction it came from.This means there is either (almost certainly) interesting new astrophysics, or (with tiny probability) new particle physics involved.

The big question is how these building blocks organized themselves into the complex structure of even the most primitive microbes.Every new form of life tends to fill successively smaller niches. There are more prokaryotes than eucaryotes, more singe celled than multi celled etc. but there is nothing in between the primordial chemical soup and the simplest life forms. I would expect a huge mass of simple RNA based life forms simpler than prokaryotes.	sthnblllII	6.4416246	0.47448352	comment	14.0	120.0	1601832556	6.904646

It's a real shame that this gap cannot be closed sooner.In undergrad I took a bunch of biology and chemistry classes.  It wasn't until I took Biochemistry (a senior level class) that everything came together. The biochemistry class I took was a re-telling of all the stories you learned in molecular biology but with the tools you acquire in organic chemistry.Equipped with those tools I relearned the Krebs cycle and photosynthesis as real chemical reactions that make sense rather than a chain of facts to be memorized.The class left me with a deep and profound reverence for life.

We never want a kid to be in the situation where they would have been interested in a subject and a career path but never ended up discovering that and using it because we didn't expose it to them.So we teach some of every subject to every kid.

Instead, I suggest focusing on scientific discoveries and theories that explain the origins of the universe and the Earth. These can be found in various fields of study, such as astronomy, geology, and biology.It's remarkable that the refusal asserting religion isn't factual would offend a significantly larger percentage of the world population than a simple reference to Genesis 1:1 would have.Such clueless tuning."

If there's a beginning, what was before the beginning? If it's infinite, how did it all start? These are the questions that I thought religion tried to answer.

In our understanding there always is a 'first'. We have only the vaguest idea in a cosmic sense how that first came to be.It's pretty neutral and sensible to call ""everything"" the creator, as Spinoza apparently did, cuz ""nothing"" sure didn't make the universe.  And as a matter of definition, that would be God.  What's so fascinating is where this thought exercise may lead.

That means they only pick 98 and 99 percentiles. For a first grader to score that high, she needs to answer the exam perfectly. If you have some statistics training, you'll see this score is like shooting yourself in the foot.

His work in linguistic is over my head, maybe it's true, I can't tell.But whenever I hear him speak outside his niche his points are stupid (like this one) or harmful (like his Ukrainian takes).Everybody sees faces in rocks because we have brains fine-tuned for seeing faces. Does it prove that there's something universal in looking like a face or even worse - being a face? Some objective ""faceiness""?Or just that we have overfitted neural networks in our heads?You can get hit in a particular way and stop recognizing faces. Or morality.What Chomsky is saying is that if you include only the people who are ""healthy"" according to some subjective criteria and take a crossection of their moralities - the result isn't an empty set.

I recommend his book Manufacturing Consent.It paints a vivid picture of the media consistently doing the government's* bidding by painting our mass murdering allies as heroes, while massively amplifying minor crimes committed by those we consider enemies (e.g. Communists). And they do this knowingly, too, by ignoring or outright silencing dissenting voices (like Chomsky's).Really opened my eyes to how propaganda actually works.It's not the overt stuff you see from the early 20th century. Instead it's subtle but pervasive omission and exaggeration of facts.* They do the same for advertisers, too, not just the government.

It was an opportunity for the locals to move around in organized groups, even march around doing military drills, without causing the colonial leadership to panic and retaliate. It would bind people together socially and get them used to coordinating under a leader, whose legitimacy would be enhanced.Sometimes people now claim that ""cargo cult science"" is not really a good analogy and should be abandoned.However, I think this newer understanding of cargo cults may actually make it an even better analogy.Even if a line of scientific ideas is mostly fake and its research practices c"	throw18376	7.1995983	0.5842713	comment	17.0	72.0	1691919334	-12.084588

This is a common misinterpretation of it and it's interesting that the quote links to the wikipedia page that has a better statement: ""Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.""The key problem is equating simplicity with correctness.  This is usually disastrous.  Once you feel that something is ""correct"" you stop looking for ways to falsify it.  That's the exact opposite for what Occam's razor is used for.Instead, if you have 2 competing hypotheses (two hypotheses for which the evidence supports both), you use the one with less assumptions.

From that experience I have made two observations:1.  These people are not idiots (at least the YECs aren't, I can't speak for the flat-earthers) and to dismiss them as idiots who will just go away is a serious mistake.

We have 180+ people working really, really hard to make Lambda School the best experience it can be. At times we’ll fall short, and, as another poster pointed out, the margin for error is just razor thin; thousands of happy and successful students can be out there, but it’s the ones who don’t make it or have a good experience that cause us to lose sleep (and make it to the top of HN).We take our responsibility in that regard very seriously; students come to us to change their lives and do something really, really difficult, and anything we do affects people in a very profound way.To the parent’s point, in this particular instance I don’t think this student's frustrations are the result of too much growth or lack of resources per s	austenallred	7.1876736	1.0589379	comment	18.0	95.0	1607955061	14.97321

This was because the government only issued birth certificates in the nearby city, and being poor & rural, it took time to get there by bus, etc.So I have aunts & uncles with real-official birthdate deltas of up to 2 weeks.I'd imagine that going back to 1900s or 1880s, when travel was more difficult, who knows.

Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF states that 'many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.'

The updated CMF looks better, but I just don't see how an educator who knows math or how to teach math could come to such a conclusion (that Calculus should not be a goal).

Natural selection is a constant force, presumably new genetic codes could offer an advantage, e.g., robustness against damaging mutation, resulting in multiple competing genetic codes.The notion of abiogenesis occurring only once on earth seems improbable considering complex organs like eyes have evolved independently several different times.

Certainly there are individuals who are more intelligent than the average, but I would argue not incomparably so.I believe he's speaking about the tendency of large groups of people to act more like cattle than people.  The intelligence of the mob (and the character, represented by the actions of the mob) are what I see as incomparably lower than that of an individual.And I think this is indicated by the other shortcomings of 20th century humanity that he passes along.  	trey-jones	7.364339	0.29053754	comment	23.0	201.0	1699629539	-1.4504836

There are services out there that will basically write your english essay for you / do your math/science homework.For college essays, they can hire college counselors to help them draft a compelling essay.For extra curriculars, they can hire a private coach, etc.However, there is very limited evidence that SAT coaching actually increases your SAT score. The NACAC did a study on this and they found that average gains of test-prep students is ~30 points (this was when the SAT was 2400 points).A 30 point increase out of 2400 points is not material to college admissions.Out of the college essay, gpa	LewisVerstappen	7.4746504	1.0320524	comment	24.0	222.0	1648486869	-2.1944828

Our method for determining admissibility reminded me of the heat map chart in this article - ie GPA on one axis, SAT/ACT score on the another axis, trace your finger along both paths to see if the applicant was in or out.I probably reviewed 20-30 applications a day. If high school transcripts were universally formatted, decisions could have been instantaneous but alas, we live in the real world and some human-in-the-loop normalizing had to be done over-and-over.With all that reviewing, patterns emerged, namely that SAT and ACT scores strongly correlate to GPA. Now, I’m the kind of person that roots for the genius to overcome his grades and emerge a genius on the SAT/ACT. But in two years, it probably happened only twice.

28437430	From the article:Over the next year,	From the article:Over the next year, a biosciences working group revised the program’s funding guidelines, stipulating in the final draft that it would not support any research into the first-order effects of genes on behavior or social outcomes.The fact that this area is controversial suggests to me that it is worth exploration.I’ve taught mathematics at community colleges for over 20 years and I’m absolutely convinced that not all people can learn algebra or calculus.  To me it is obvious this is so since the mentally disabled can’t.  There’s a level of “intelligence” that’s necessary to learn a given topic.  Not everyone can learn all topics.This belief of mine is considered heretical amongst leftist colleagues (I’m a liberal myself on almost every issue).

36861652	I'm still interested in any viable t	I'm still interested in any viable theory as to how random chemical processes are able to garner enough information in their own structure to replicate themselves.That is, Von Neumann showed us that to have a self-replicating automaton we need both the factory and the information for the factory (saved within it). We know that's what a cell is. But how do random chemical processes get there?Note: time works against chemical processes since the organic chemical compounds decay, keep that in mind when creating a hypothesis.Note 2: remember that in this case, both the factory & the information gets randomly mutated until you have a factory and information that's complex enough to error correct.	ezion	6.6574197	0.087381355	comment	30.0	179.0	1690290549	-7.436218
