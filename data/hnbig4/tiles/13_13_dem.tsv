The town requires summer short term rental landlords to get a permit & inspection.
The landlord did not get one.
The landlord also had sketchy kitchen wiring that was probably some sort of DIY and not up to code.
The landlord had removed batteries and hardwiring from 3 smoke detectors.
These are the kind of things the inspector would have found immediately.A family visiting from out of state lost 2 of their 3 children in this fire.Apps like AirBnB create the facade of officialness on what are instead very sketchy markets.

In New York I'm not sure you can find alot of 5 or 6 bedroom places, especially in Manhattan.So airbnb's main draw for most people just isn't available in New York in a way that it would be in most other large cities.Which means you'd expect alot less people to use airbnb over a hotel in New York.	chollida1	9.267509	7.635881	comment	3.0	12.0	1696351598	13.961078

We had one flat rented out all summer on Airbnb and it turned me from being 'meh' about the idea to being totally against it.None of the other owners/residents were consulted or told about the Airbnb, so the first thing I knew was a group of Germans at my door asking me questions about their stay, and whether I could give them a bottle of olive oil. Fortunately for them I was bemused enough to help them out rather than to think ""well no, I've been at work all day, and nobody's paying me to be your concierge"".Then there was a family who stood in the communal, enclosed hallway and smoked every night.

In a nutshell, that you can't have a high quality growth company forever in an industry with a fixed supply of high quality items.Initially, you grow like crazy and with great user reviews, as you're able to pick and choose the highest quality items.Unfortunately, at some point you exhaust the supply at a given quality level, but your valuation mandates continued growth.So you lower your quality requirements to obtain more supply, which only buys you a bit more time until you hit the next supply limit.The only winning move seems to be stay private and accept there's a near-term cap on your revenue growth, after which you will grow much more slowly (at the natural supply expansion rate).	ethbr0	9.3086605	7.6216536	comment	3.0	12.0	1670811153	13.957605

Meanwhile, if they were still able to receive their guests' money without said guests actually residing at their units due to the pandemic, it looks like theft on the host's part more than anything else -- they are profiting off a pandemic for free because of an overly strict policy that prevents their would-be guests from being refunded for social distancing and ensuring public safety.

If some hosts over-extended themselves on mortgages for their rental properties and get foreclosed on, that's not really Airbnb's problem. They may even get bailed out by the government, which then directly benefits Airbnb.And in the medium term, I think their booking rates might bounce back quicker than other hotels.

Which means you aren't going to ""live like a local anyway"" if you only have 72 hours.The places actual locals frequent will  now become boxes to be ticked on a ""live like a local curated airbnb experience.""

13302706	Which hotel regulations do you think	Which hotel regulations do you think are overly onerous and ridiculous?  Most of those regulations were put in place to protect communities and customers, not the hotels themselves.  Zoning laws prevent tourists from overrunning resident communities where people don't want them.  Safety and health regulations ensure that customers won't get injured or sick during their stay.  Taxes help cities pay for all the improvements, services, etc. that residents want.And yes, Airbnb is skirting the law in the loaded sense of the term.  They basically encourage illegal rentals and then refuse to police them until cities like NYC force them to.  They might not be directly in violation of laws themselves, but they're definitely knowingly enabling their customers to do illegal things.	mdorazio	9.276654	7.628503	comment	3.0	17.0	1483378479	13.949002

It's hotel regulation.What ABnB has demonstrated is that there is a vastly underserved market for regular travellers, who have no interest in 'having their sheets changed every day' - rather, they just want a decent and convenient space - and they can't afford the $250/night for a boring room 'corporate' rate.If hotels and their regulations were efficient - then AirBnB would only be used what is was kind of meant for: either sharing/hosting - or - renting out fairly 'special' places that just don't fit regular criteria.Most AirBnB stays are a matter of price and convenience.The fact that I can stay in cities, in a decent place for less than 1/2 the cost of a hotel is what makes me hate AirBnB less than hotels and city regulators.Something is deeply wr	sonnyblarney	9.263607	7.6475487	comment	3.0	30.0	1540614167	13.963227

For instance there's probably tons of people whod jump on doctors/dentists who lower the price by not cleaning all their tools properly, but we have regulations requiring it because it can create an epidemic that causes negative externalities to the wider community.I think I'd have less of a problem with Airbnb if there was any sort of enforcement of health laws or putting effort into not supporting people who sign leases saying they won't do Airbnb but do it anyway.Having a lower	lovich	9.262309	7.6417947	comment	3.0	12.0	1540614642	13.932408

16234674	In places with limited rental proper	"In places with limited rental properties, some people have got leases on apartments and are then renting them out via AirBnB instead of living in them. This decreases the total amount of apartments available for long-term renters.In NYC, you can rent a room out as AirBnb if either of the following:  1. the rental is long term
  2. you are present in the apartment while the guest is staying

The issue with the third case:  3. short term rental while owner is absent

is that the apartment is a secondary rental unit for the host/owner and is not a primary residence for the guest. Rich people can afford this, poorer people cannot. Hence the problem.That is when AirBnB does not help the housing market and some cities have rightfully legislated against that case."	dbmikus	9.266039	7.6443744	comment	3.0	13.0	1516914386	13.95445

He was eager to create new, cash-generating ventures at Airbnb, people familiar with his work said. He quietly built a hedge fund within the company’s finance department. He used a portion of capital from the balance sheet to buy stocks, currencies and fixed-income securities, mimicking the treasury fund he ran at Blackstone. The side project represented 30 percent of the company’s cash flow last year and made about $5 million a month for Airbnb, the people said.	jonknee	9.265462	7.6535063	comment	3.0	35.0	1517982951	13.963285

But the edge cases aren't even edge cases anymore.Just within the last few days one of the more popular buildings in our neighborhood had a shooting. The owners and tenants are absolutely pissed. Because at $3000+/month this is not how they wanted to live. That building management company was fired and a new one brought in.

Feels bad that people did that.I think Airbnb when it first came out was great.  Like all things tech (a bit broad of a statement) once it got out into the world in a real way it lost its allure.  Facebook was great when it started, reddit, instagram, google, etc.  Once people figure out how to co-opt the technology for their own uses (or maybe just the drive for ad revenue kills off all the fun or novelty wears off) it loses its lustre quite a bit.  Sorry to be downbeat - technology doesn't feel as fun as it was even like 3-4 years ago let alone back in the 00s or the 90s.  Or maybe I'm just aging out.	boringg	9.271675	7.6466227	comment	3.0	10.0	1607646652	13.959257

I take pride in my property and lived there myself for years.But I've gotten guests who nit pick everything and then ask for a refund. I had one guest ask for a refund because there was snow in Tahoe, and they stayed for the full time anyway. Another guest wanted a refund because my shower curtains were expanding tension rods and not permanently mounted.Generally it still makes sense for me, but running an Airbnb well takes a lot of effort.

Based on your example, the engineers are highly overpaid as there efforts rarely generate a profit. They are being paid by funds from speculators (stockholders and venture capital) that are betting on huge profits in the future.In reality, these engineers are being paid due to labor market forces and extremely focused recruiting policies (eg only hiring those with degrees from top engineering schools or poaching workers from other companies that have similar policies).	cudgy	9.272955	7.644158	comment	3.0	12.0	1649239654	13.950908

Surely there aren't literally 10x more rooms on AirBnB then there are renters in Dublin?I am also very frustrated at rental markets in many place, though I'm still unsure how much of this is merely displacing hotels/hostels relative to actually sucking up long-term rental slots.I am very prepared to lay a lot of blame on Airbnb for high prices, just haven't seen anything conclusive (US-centric stuff I've seen, the fact that building has crawled to a halt feels way more relevant)"	rtpg	9.272285	7.6367807	comment	3.0	14.0	1684225234	13.956014

Going to daft.ie, Ireland's main rental site, there's only 200 one-bed places to let (and that includes one room open in otherwise occupied houses). An order of magnitude difference, and it'll get worse throughout the summer.It's a cancer that has directly impacted and caused the skyrocketing of prices and constraint of supply. The answer isn't to (just) build more, but to end the exploitation from AirBnB.And, as mentioned, it's worse in other cities.	dorchadas	9.276342	7.6342435	comment	3.0	17.0	1684225818	-7.486964

Take for example the city I grew up in - Edinburgh. Tourism contributes £1.3bn to the cities economy, but the city has a GDP of £26bn. So tourism is 5% of GDP, yet it has a completely disproportionate impact on the city centre.If you play ""count the lockboxes"" in the centre you realise almost every flat in the centre is an AirBnB. Those flats take in 4x what a normal rented flat will make, so of course there's a strong incentive for landlords to rent on AirBnB. Right now the city is going through a huge housing shortage - people are having to defer degree courses or live outside the city because they literally can't find anywhere to rent.Of course, tourists aren't th"	leoedin	9.273508	7.631395	comment	3.0	23.0	1684227622	13.9529085

A lot of countries have a requirement for you to reside in it for at least half the year to be able to be taxed there and be considered an employee. A lot of countries allow people to visit for limited time, as long as you don’t interfere with the local job market - e.g being a tourist.

They chat people up, and if they strike up a rapport they suggest customers contact them directly, cutting out the middle man. They can even undercut Uber, and still make more money than they do with Uber.This especially makes sense for people who have a regular commute to the airport etc. I've experienced the same thing with Airbnb: first stay via the platform, and further stays booked directly. With Airbnb you miss out on the platform's protections. But with Uber, as the drivers are getting paid less and less, it seems easier to slide into direct contact.It can be useful to have a private car driver you know and trust, without the anxiety of the wait, or of drivers calling you to ask where you're going, only to cancel the ride.

It's for good measure, Airbnbs in Barcelona, Lisboa and a number of other European cities have priced out the local population, investors buying 4-10 apartments on the same house to rent out as short-term rentals.Airbnb created a pressure in the housing market that didn't exist before, for cities that already suffered with housing it really really sucks.So it's the same as Uber: get into a regulatory grey area, capture the market and then fight over so regulations don't catch up with you.

Hotels are the obvious answer, but AFAIK hotels still have customers. So what is happening? Are there more travelers than before (outside of pandemics)?Not saying that there is no problem with AirBnB, but it shouldn't reduce housing supply unless there is some deeper underlying problem.

Before Airbnb you had to be a hotel to offer short  term rental, so most landlords stayed out of that business and stuck to long term rental even though there's less revenue per unit.But with Airbnb you can take your units out of the long term rental pool and put them in the short term rental pool, and because regulation has been slow to catch up, you don't have to take on the regulatory burden	jordanb	9.267624	7.640964	comment	4.0	27.0	1515985505	13.964114

They're providing a market that fulfills demand for low cost or privately owned accommodations, competing directly with the established hotel industry.

Really look at AirBnb, Bird, etc and they all offload externalities from the company and it’s customers to everyone around them.When the basic building model is to break the law, chances are the law had a point and people are going to want a return to normal eventually.  The only way they survive long term is if the general population feels it’s the new normal is a useful tradeoff.  In the short term they can massively subsidize users, but long term the same basic economic reality sets in so they need some actual innovation.

Airbnb is always the answer.There's something really impersonal about staying in a hotel that you don't get with an Airbnb (although some airbnbs are  pretty bad as well).I remember almost all the airbnbs I've stayed at.

Many US cities are composed primarily of 2-3 story houses which have been converted into dingy expensive apartments. This is utterly unacceptable from an efficiency standpoint.

There could be a new supply of housing on the market, as much of it was speculatively picked up. It's true that you can earn more operating a unit as a short-term rental, however in aggregate only so many can do that before demand dries up or price competition undercuts the increased profitably when compared to a long term tenant.

Not with the original plan (leveraging idle capacity in the existing driver network) but instead by just discovering that urban customers are willing to be insane premiums (50%ish) to get food brought to them and that restaurants are too desperate for business to say no. Covid was probably the best thing that ever happened to Uber here, that’s when most people I know got addicted to food delivery.I really wonder if that will continue or if there will be a change in consumer attitudes towards food delivery.	habosa	9.8008795	7.501936	comment	4.0	22.0	1690897459	-2.414361

Wouldn't people coming to Lisbon just stay somewhere else if short-term rentals didn't exist - like a hotel that is likely owned by a massive corporation? How would that be better?I guess that way I look at it is that people want to visit cities for a variety of reasons. Those people need to stay somewhere. Wherever they stay will take up space, thus driving up rents through land scarcity. I am not really sure how people staying in someone's apartment is much worse than staying in a hotel.If rents are going up, it's because there is more demand than supply. Unless Airbnb is actually increasing demand (perhaps?), I don't see how it is really affecting this equation.	santoshalper	9.274505	7.626416	comment	4.0	18.0	1607663547	13.948775

This move will draw further attention to their lack of adherence to ""common carrier"" laws, which prevent hotels (and some other types of businesses) from treating customers in this way. It may be that Airbnb is not subject to these laws as written, but by taking stands like this it becomes more likely that the laws will be amended to force them to comply.Taking a stand like this will also make Airbnb less popular in some circles.

32194488	AirBNB is now almost as expensive as	AirBNB is now almost as expensive as a hotel in the city centre. There are some very nice properties, but increasingly a lot of crappy properties - flats converted into multiple airbnb 'apartments', bare minimum furniture, often in dodgy areas, and your neighbours are also airbnb tenants so expect lots of noise.For this reason I also have gone back to hotels unless I'm booking a place for more than 2 weeks. Airbnb often has a monthly discount so remains a decent place for long stays, although if you put in the work (and pay cash) you can usually find cheaper options.	rjh29	9.264511	7.637408	comment	4.0	22.0	1658510096	13.960796

We were at the wedding when it occurred but I sometimes think about what would have happened if we were sleeping inside at the time. There would have been no escape except through the upper-story window.The host initially accused us of causing the fire through negligence, then it was eventually revealed to be an electrical fault in the building, which had been built by the homeowner himself.The bigger problem was that they hadn’t told their insurance company they were subletting. We eventually agreed a deal with lawyers for them to compensate us. (It probably goes without saying that AirBnB was of course no help throughout the whole process.)It occurred to me that none of this would have occurred in a regular hotel.

There's a simple solution that works: Require the owner live on the property. Every AirBnB investor will skip the city/county if that is the rule, but still leaves room for legitimate residents to make some money (e.g. rent out the basement, etc). The latter isn't taking housing away from anyone - for most owners it's not economical to convert the basement to make it a long term rental.

If someone is a terrible customer, then they can probably make things a lot worse for the driver or host than vice versa, and without these scores, drivers might not be able to warn other drivers about them. I would hope that with other modern customer service jobs, that reverse-ratings are always employed. It is a measurable way to improve the jobs of customer service workers.	virtuous_signal	9.937866	7.5888658	comment	4.0	35.0	1581123460	9.313183

I think AirBnB would do themselves a favor by incorporating the cleaning fee into the base price and not calling it out separately.As for the chore list, I may recall a couple annoying ones from years past, but usually it's a non-issue.

The hotel lobby certainly would be in favor of loosening safety regulations in general as compliance will certainly cut into their bottom line at least a little.	nommm-nommm	9.27015	7.638715	comment	4.0	14.0	1492440601	13.96304

Finally, when we came back after a day at the falls, there were police notices on the house stating that it's illegal for anyone to occupy the property, as it was being used as illegal vacation rental.

That target customer is a demographic that I had aged out of before they started.

I want minimum, verified internet speed, a real desk with a real desk chair, a external monitor I can plug in to. I don't want to book a place for a month and then have to leave because I cannot work.

The sunk cost fallacy is alive and well here, people don't want to lose money just because they feel sick even though they know they shouldn't go when not feeling well.  I think at this time the travel industry needs to stand up and relax it's policies even further.Airbnb will not refund you a stay unless your flight has been cancelled by the airline.  Unfortunately the airlines are giving options right now, Delta for example let's you rebook or get refunds to some countries that are trying to shut down this virus at it's source.  But not feeling safe, along with being given a refund on a nonrefundable ticket does not matter to Airbnb at all.

Occasionally he'd go on a trip and AirBnb out his own unit.It was enough money for him to cover his mortgage and not have to work if he watched his spending. He's bleeding money now and it started about two months ago.

It was scary for sure for a span of several weeks, but there were always other contingencies before liquidating (like converting it to a long term rental).Even if I went along with the panic, it would take probably three months to go through with any transaction that would throw a desirable property onto the market.  The demand is still so strong that the low price would likely chum the waters and competitive bidding would drive the price up.I think these Airbnb liquidation sale headlines are being sensational and end up wasting buyers time.	louiswilbrink	9.268078	7.645716	comment	5.0	26.0	1589210251	13.958775

The first trip was booked for a month, but we got sick of ants, mice and lack of action after about a week and left early. The second was so incredibly filthy that we left the morning after checking in. While Airbnb corrected the issues by letting us get out early, this was incredibly disruptive to our plans and not representative of what was promised.The worst part came later, after our mutual reviews for that second place became public. My review and scores got removed with no notice, so that host c	romanhn	9.257322	7.6484795	comment	5.0	21.0	1597215489	13.962183

I also get using Uber eats if you’re ordering in with family or friends.That’s not what I see with Uber eats. I see people ordering one sub from Firehouse. Or a burger from McDonald’s. I’ve never felt so lazy I needed to tip someone and pay extra for McDonald’s or Chipotle and I can be lazy.Same with grocery shopping. I’d never pay extra to have someone do it for me but it’s pretty popular in my area.	wil421	9.854402	7.4159126	comment	5.0	16.0	1560796355	-2.23698

I can't blame the landlords in this case.. It's obviously the better option for them, even as the article suggests, the landlords can afford to have the locations close during the `off-season` because there is so much money to be made.Some regulation around the pricing would be nice, but I have no idea how you would even navigate doing that.	bilekas	9.272281	7.6319966	comment	5.0	43.0	1684226400	-7.504966

AirBnB runs afoul of the hotel laws and makes the neighbors of AirBnb hosts have to deal with the problems while also decreasing supply of housing and pushing up housing prices in cities and communities. Uber basically was an illegal taxi service and succeeded by paying their workers often times less than minimum wage by classifying them as contractors. They also took shortcuts on their self-driving cars and killed a pedestrian. They have also tried to suppress rape victims stories going so far as to invade their medical records.To succeed as a business, you have to do something that others can’t do or won’t do	RcouF1uZ4gsC	9.574921	7.6665606	comment	5.0	32.0	1572361092	13.969204

This is a pre-internet idea (e.g., casas particulares in Cuba in the 1990s) that becomes way easier/safer/better with a web-based platform. Personally, I find it massively more fun to stay in a typical home in a region that I'm visiting, and I can often find these on AirBnB.Of course AirBnB is going to try to grow as much as possible to try to eat hotel revenues and develop new markets.

Now we basically live next door to a motel with constant in/out and their hired maids shouting ""housekeeping"" at 8am. Airbnb can take their $1m and shove it up their asses. I support anything that helps bring down this model of turning neighborhoods into decentralized hotels, up to and including occasional acts of arson which unfort"	noduerme	9.268247	7.6305976	comment	5.0	23.0	1655891312	13.965356

But my solution is to just live like a local wherever I want and pay someone else’s mortgage. It’s a lifestyle that suits me and I have the cash flow to do it. Do I care that I am in a house next to some owner who doesn’t want me there? You own a house and I don’t, so screw you. I know this sounds a bit nasty but I am offering a genuine take that puts airbnb as sort of a weapon between the haves (house owners) and have nots (nomads).	enos_feedler	9.266276	7.6412625	comment	5.0	18.0	1658509261	13.968398

You can pick up a box of kitchen supplies (pots, knives, etc) from the front desk or request room service to cart them up.Put the supplies back in the box before you leave (box is lined with a rubbermaid dish bin).This would offset the cost of furnishing each room with supplies, while also killing one of airbnb's value props.	devmunchies	9.259542	7.583849	comment	5.0	15.0	1658512075	13.922487

The consensus seems to be that the price difference is diminished and the high variance in quality is not worth whatever discount still exists.I have some good memories from the early years of talking with hosts and even having them show me around, it’s a shame that it’s become so transactional but I don’t see how it could have scaled any other way.	paulgb	9.265699	7.6429343	comment	6.0	42.0	1689725651	13.954932

Proving this thesis would be Airbnb can show on S1 the % of guest who book outside their home location and for stays more then 2 weeks (to account that it is not simply vacation time).2.

One listed the wrong location and if they had listed the correct location I would not have rented even though the room's interior matched. A few claimed to include onsite parking but didn't which of course is very inconvenient. The last one that did that claimed ""Easy Street Parking"" as AirBnb's blatant lie. I usually had to park a mile way or pay for a $25 a night garage a few blocks away. One claimed wifi but was actually just stealing it from the neighbors and it only worked in a corner of the apartment if lucky.

It's just a de-facto commercial zoning grant to all residential areas. It's going to decrease the pool of available properties for long-term residents and raise the rents for those residents because every property manager is going to have to decide whether they think they could make more money by renting to an individual long-term or by just perpetually listing on Airbnb.This really isn't a victory for anybody	Spivak	9.267881	7.645295	comment	6.0	42.0	1504046747	13.957283

So we end up with attractive historical districts with predominantly temporary rentals which are completely empty out of the season, and dull residential districts where people earning local salaries can afford to live.

Sure, there were some issues here and there that would not have occurred at a hotel. But I'll be damned if it wasn't nice to stay nestled into the local neighborhoods, and meet (and sometimes drink) with the hosts, who were always gracious and helpful in pointing out the best places to check out that are off-the-beaten-path.For what it's worth, dedicated buildings for AirBnB's really rub me the wrong way, because it often takes away from the charming/local feel of the place/host.

Thinking back on the marketing, Airbnb in my mind occupied the same space as a hotel, but actually it's intensely more social than that. I was shocked when I first tried it and found it was so built on a one-on-one experience.Granted, I only ever did this once, and maybe 6 or 7 years ago at that, but I vastly prefer the idea of an impersonal hotel check-in desk 	vsnf	9.267049	7.647332	comment	6.0	21.0	1658508860	13.958363

The problem, of course, is that doing that requires regulating and monitoring the subscribers (as AirBnB will have to) contrary to the claim in the ruling[1]I expect either this will be overturned on appeal, or it will provide a path for media companies to bend ISPs and others to their will, as they've tried to for years[1]

It's puzzling as it seems to be at the expense of other search filtering.They've reduced useful search filters like 'has a desk' and there is no filter for 'not a tent or van' which is increasingly common. Some areas (Hawaii) contain vans as the majority of their listings. But no filters against them.Their direction reminds me of the progress of Netflix to be less searchable and more about content they want to push. I guess it works out in the a/b tests but likely misses the forest for the trees.A tip: use airbnb.com.au instead of .com as you'll get the real full price in the searches as they must comply with Australian law. This works all over the world.	throwaway13337	9.268514	7.6206594	comment	8.0	49.0	1655887846	10.167112

I think AirBnb should show initial totals with it included, so you're never surprised by it. But it shouldn't be rolled up into the nightly rate because it really is a one-off.As an example, right now I'm looking at doing an extended trip, on the order of 2-4 weeks. I just need one cleaning at the end. If they inflate the daily rate to cover cleaning, I'll end up paying a lot more than the average weekender trip. Or if they hide it in a variable price, then I'll have a hard time comparing different lengths of stays across different places.	wpietri	9.245591	7.5780463	comment	8.0	59.0	1676918114	-11.238791

By now, it's a mature company.But if you compare it's business with Booking, you'll see that Booking is much cheaper not only as a guest, but also as an investor, having wider revenues + net income as well.It's long gone the times since Airbnb was cheaper than a hotel, I remember back in the days, it would be roughly 50% cheaper. Nowadays, it's about the same price as a hotel.For some occasions, like when you want to rent a home for 4 or more, it might make sense, but I fail to see how it's going to stay competitive in the long run.Maybe now they are targeting a different customer than me, that likes to travel on a budget.

Years ago, staying at an Airbnb was a fun novelty and often I could save a buck. Now the novelty has worn off and the predatory fee structures make me weary.There aren't many things an Airbnb does in a place like NYC that a hotel can't do better. Hotels are ubiquitous and uniform. You generally always know what you're getting into, and if something is amiss you can usually get it corrected by staff on-site or migrate to a nearby competitor. With Airbnb, you'll be lucky if you can reach a human to help with what will inevitably go wrong. Instead of full-time housekeeping, you'll have to put up with the shoddy resetting that a bottom-rate contractor cleaner	bigyikes	9.263633	7.637286	comment	8.0	58.0	1696717598	13.964901

Using AirBNB (or equivalent service) saved me well over $1500 for the trip - we would have needed three hotel rooms but rented a house instead. As an added bonus, instead of all that money going to a large corporation, it will go to an individual.The level of myopia here is staggering. The sharing economy is a tidal wave of economic change - mostly for good. You'd throw pebbles at it trying to stop it.

Uber argues it is a technology company first, and drives/delivers second, whereas the judge argues the opposite. Convincing arguments can be made for both sides.The modifications discussed in the top-level post address the A and C portions of the test, but not B unfortunately.

He barely has parking for 3 cars, 2 cars if you don't want to be boxed in. However he rents out room for 6 people. He constantly has business moving through his house, occasionally his guests encroach on our driveway which is adjacent to his.The city has not been able to catch up with the modern world and has no policy or licensing for Airbnb style businesses.The pandemic has had zero impact on his ability to rent out rooms, it's always full.TLDNR: I wish I had a neighbour and not a business next to me in a residentially zoned street./rant	monkeynotes	9.26996	7.6429505	comment	10.0	39.0	1594817165	13.963538

First, it's really not much cheaper than a hotel in most cases (some cases more expensive). Second, it's a hassle when you're on vacation to have to arrange in advance a specific time to pick up the keys to the place. Then, what happens if you happen to lose the keys (happened to me once)? What happens if it's in the middle of the night in a foreign country? This could be a nightmare. On top of that, you're expected to leave the apartment like you never stayed there or face bad reviews (even with a $100+ cleaning fee)!

I think it's a great way to live, and it teaches you a lot about yourself.We used to just find vacation rentals. One of the key tricks I used when AirBnb came out was figuring out who the owner was and contacting them directly with a cash offer for 3 months rent with ~25% (sometimes 50%) knocked off if I pay in USD up front.

So you have to read them all to make sure you do not miss recent complaints.AirBnB does not show the exact location of the apartments.AirBnB sometimes removes negative reviews for no good reason.AirBnB lets hosts get away with removing their listing (due to negative reviews) and relist them with a clean slate.I really hope AirBnB will stay strong.

The experience was terrible.  Constant noise, incredibly inconsiderate people leaving trash everywhere, etc. The interesting thing is the short-term units weren't cheap; they were actually rather expensive.  So it wasn't as though we were getting a bunch of college partier types; they were typically young professionals.  Given how unpleasant it was, I can't imagine how bad it would be if the quality of guests had been different.The building was a large house th	joshgev	9.264772	7.6408353	comment	11.0	122.0	1600789205	13.946421

Airbnb is also a deeply harmful influence on housing prices.Imagine if we did the same thing with, say, water: privatized it and then ""democratized"" ownership of it.It's easy to get retail investors to buy things at inflated, speculative prices, so the price of water would go up. People would say, ""Why are so many people dying due to lack of access to water?"" And we would blame these startups, laws would be passed, and we would fix it.Unfortunately the necessity of housing is not as direct and clear, and we have a long history of denying housing to people who are unlucky, sick, or the children of such people."	smt88	9.268207	7.6397243	comment	11.0	84.0	1660392815	13.956744

People buy on AirBNB and Uber because it's cheaper than an equivalent hotel or taxi. People sell on AirBNB and Uber because they need the extra income.For a short while, VC investments paid out as bonuses to the participants, and just the novelty of the thing might keep both sides happy. But eventually there has to be a balance found between ""I want to pay less"" and ""I want to earn as much as before"" and ""government wants as much taxes as before""."

Have submitters provide the street address and URL of the AirBnB to make it easy. The person operating the AirBnB (or owner of the house) gets fined. The person submitting the tip about an illegal AirBnB receives 25% of the fine.It wouldn't take long for illegal AirBnBs to close up shop when they realize there are negative repercussions for what they're doing.

It's one of my favourite startups, from both a user's and entrepreneur's point of view.I really loved the way Brian described it as - this is how it used to be, go to a place and stay with a local. I don't like the formality, isolation, or artificiality of hotels so Airbnb has been a wonderful opportunity.Recently, though, I've found more and more properties managed by one person. It's hard to be sure I'm staying with a local making some cash off their spare room, rather than someone ""farming"" a bunch of cheap properties. I wondered if Airbnb were permitting or encouraging this; the article suggests it is the latter.For me, this ruins the whole point of Airbnb. Long-term it will devalue the experience by turning it into a substandard, impersonal distributed hotel. I really h"	randomsearch	9.264962	7.6411314	comment	14.0	63.0	1473835436	13.957335

Many hosts will foreclose on their rented properties during 2020 or convert to long-term rentals. Airbnb may lost inventory for multiple years, not just months.The second wave will be the nail in the coffin for a lot of companies, I think Airbnb is one of them unfortunately.	ping_pong	9.267109	7.649067	comment	14.0	79.0	1588707716	13.96669

Alas, the price barely moved in my area, much to my surprise and frustration.	ashtonkem	9.266434	7.637042	comment	14.0	89.0	1589208511	13.960311

In most places Airbnbs will be a bit dirtier than a hotel but in NY it wasn't even close. Rats, cockroaches, showers that don't drain, grime everywhere... After a few experiences like that I was out. Hotels in NY offer a much better experience.	hypeit	9.26616	7.629227	comment	14.0	84.0	1696351235	13.940942

Don't rent out your home if you don't want the risk of people damaging it!(As a minor aside, I've also noticed the quality of the places I've found on AirBnB has gone down.  The homes I stayed at before I quit using it were not very clean (despite the fee!), things were broken, key retrieval was a pain etc.  Hotels used to be much more expensive, but price/quality of experience is starting to get more competitive)It's funny to me, because AirBnB runs in to all the same problems we had with hotels 	eric_b	9.262524	7.641622	comment	16.0	107.0	1547646898	13.963384

It's not salary per se but those that benefit by renting out units or those for whom this has saved them money I've found typically get so defensive about AirBnB to the point of calling detractors NIMBYists and the like.I've long thought that AirBnB allows people to profit off something that others around them bear the negative externalities from but I think it's even worse than I would've pegged it. Clear negatives:1. Reduces housing supply;2. Creates safety problems;3. Creates nuisance problems; and4. Brings temporary residents into neighbourhoods that have no tie to that neighbourhood.To be clea	cletus	9.265378	7.645841	comment	20.0	203.0	1626908467	13.965446

They loose can ""superhost"" status and other such things after a couple non-5 star reviews. Giving a 1-star review is probably worse than causing $100+ in damage for some of a lot of these hosts.Hosts will rarely rate guests < 5 stars, simply for fear of retaliation.The problem here is that guests are never told that 5 stars = normal stay. This leads to problems. If AirBnB was more up front about expectations it would make their review system a lot better."	mox1	9.257668	7.648015	comment	21.0	113.0	1583520837	13.956665

21409463	There have been a few threads about 	There have been a few threads about AirBnb lately with a lot of people reporting negative experiences so I will add my own $0.02. I have stayed in many AirBnbs. The reason is, I find it is the only way to have a tolerable family vacation is when everyone has their own sleeping quarters. When we are all piled into one (often overpriced and not so clean) hotel room, it makes for less than ideal sleep and everyone ends up grouchy. Plus when you travel with children, it is really nice to have a kitchen and a way to do laundry.  At any rate, my observation for all my AirBnb stays is most of them are quite nice. Many hosts go to great lengths to have their guests have a nice stay. There have been a few crappy experiences, but not many. The main downside for me concerning AirBnb is it takes a lon	julienchastang	9.263373	7.6416087	comment	24.0	196.0	1572533623	13.956506

They hide their phone number, then force you to go through a ticketing system for urgent issues. Then, they start assigning you a new ""case manager"" every few hours as their shifts change, which means the rep never is caught up on the issue. Sometimes, they forget to transfer you to a new rep before ending their shift, which could result in zero responses for days until the rep works again.- When "	philip1209	9.26258	7.649035	comment	25.0	169.0	1547658056	-10.361536

I have a condo in a building where most of the units are listed on Airbnb or Booking.com, quality of life for residents like me has been drastically reduced by noisy tourists that come for a weekend trip and have no regard for keeping it quiet or keeping the shared spaces clean.  I hope more cities begin to ban Airbnb.  Tourists belong in hotels not in buildings where families try to live their daily lives and have to go to work.  I've had to call the police on party goers and notoriously have to knock on noisy doors, I seriously hope Airbnb goes bankrupt and that cities ban the whole business model.

How am I going to put small children on a plane and hope everything is fine when we land? They didn't care. They were doing everything they could for the host. Finally after 3 days of arguing back and forth one of the off shore customer service representatives gave us a refund.I shouldn't have to spend 12 hours on the phone over the course of three days, having my vacation completely ruined, just to get what I deserve which was my money back.	bastardoperator	9.255809	7.6500196	comment	28.0	200.0	1658505540	13.966272
