I wonder how this phrase manages to hold after 50 years since its inception.We could compare it to the state of general AI, but at least in the machine learning field, progress is being made without knowing the feasibility or path to reaching general in AI. In fusion it appears that the theory has already been set and maintaining the chain reaction going for long enough is the limitation (progress being made here), would it be the same case that the final steps are still missing without a clear path, or would the current progress be enough to eventually reach it?"

The reactor itself cannot explode in any way shape or form, because there is nothing in there to explode. It also doesn't produce any radioactive isotopes while running, it just fuses(hence fusion) hydrogen into helium, just like the sun does. You can just capture this helium and sell it to make baloons if you want.The reaction itself kicks off a huge amount of neutron radiation, which eventually makes the reactor chamber radioactive - that is the only radioactive waste that will have to be disposed safely eventually. But neither the fuel nor the resulting product are radioactive.	gambiting	5.0987053	0.96296966	comment	3.0	18.0	1623944812	-8.62555

Everything I heard was that the quantities are so great that if we could just nail the sustained fusion reaction we could harvest potentially limitless energy.As I've come to understand it however, it is not so simple. The big question is in how long you can sustain the reaction and how much energy it costs to start it in the first place.

It seemed like NIF was all about the stockpile stewardship first, and fusion research was a secondary consideration.The capability of the NIF to get positive energy from the energy that they impart on the Hohlraum itself is neat, but I constantly discount any milestones that Livermore/NIF report, because the inertial confinement approach has such higher barriers to commercialization than tokamak style approaches, that I just consign it to ""boondoggle"" in my head.Yeah, the lasers could be 20x more efficient, and yeah, they probably could figure out how to pump 10s of targe"	steve_avery	5.1384816	0.9702969	comment	3.0	20.0	1670878931	6.712827

28232103	Because to power a type 2 civilizati	Because to power a type 2 civilization you need around 4 * 10^26W (as the paper states). Over a year that is around 10^31 kWh worth of energy. Assuming fusion can transform 1% of the input mass in energy you need ~ 1.4 * 10^19 kg per year. To put that number into perspective mount Everest weights 2.7×10^14 kg [1] so thousands Everests worth of mass.That is a lot of mass to extract and transport to the power stations (accelerate, decelerate). So it just makes sense to only needing to build the facilities to collect the power from existing sources (stars, black holes) without the logistics of transporting the fuel.Moreover, the space around a star or black hole is real estate that would go unused otherwise, while asteroids, moons, ... are more likely usable by such an advanced civilization.[	marcyb5st	5.1149797	0.9572875	comment	3.0	17.0	1629367562	-8.646416

I can't find any references, but as far as I remember the substrate they are using needs to be cooled to (WRONG, it was cooled to 20degK, see reply by MauranKilom) 60-70 degK to achieve super conductivity. Compare to magnets used in ITER which need to be cooled to 4degK.

Since neutron bombardment also turns any material radioactive, not only do you need to tear down your fusion plant (or at least the expensive reactor part of it) every few years, but you have to do it with radiation-resistant robots, as human workers can't get close to the reactor after it's been operating for a while.https://thebulletin.org/fusion-energy-nuclear-fusion/	tsimionescu	5.112992	0.96026254	comment	3.0	10.0	1631169957	-8.566799

And as I said they're still making improvements to superconductors.Another idea used is FLiBe salt as a coolant. One of the issues with Fusion reactors is that most metals can't withstand the neutron flux.

Even if you just include the volume of the plasma, it's 0.6 MW/m^3.What about higher field concepts like MIT's ARC reactor?

The usual limitation seems to be that it's only a tiny minority of places in the lattice that have the right geometry to enable fusion, perhaps because because it's under strain from a nearby defect. When fusion events happen, it's likely to  rearrange several nearby atoms. So you run out of the special lattice locations after a while.You can, of course, melt and re-cast the metal and hope to have a new crop of active lattice points, and it becomes a question of how much energy in vs. energy out.	tlb	5.1221266	0.93941104	comment	3.0	10.0	1600873660	-8.679518

While here, the power generation itself won't have such a drastic impact (unless humanity overdoes it, though, we seem to always do that) but maybe more power means more consumption and demand for other goods that get used up while using things that consume power. And with enough power you can think about making things that consume more or even build more things that consume more power. Lots of processes that were considered too wasteful suddenly become feasible.Just like with digital documents, when people predicted that paper wouldn't	wnkrshm	5.112613	0.952224	comment	3.0	23.0	1632998381	-8.662345

If so then in the simplest way I can explain it:Atoms are like little magnets that repel each other.To get fusion you need to get the atoms to touch - but you can't, they repel. So you have to press them together really really hard, to force them.The only way we know to do that involves lots of temperature and pressure. Cold fusion simply doesn't press them together hard enough.The idea of cold fusion was that certain metals would act like magnet-shields, stopping the atoms from repelling.

There isn't a snowball's chance in hell that fusion will make it in time. I can't over-emphasize how dire our current situation is - and that's with us currently living in a world where 3 cent/kwh solar power exists.If we're gambling on fusion, at this point, the best-case outcome for it would be that it could be brought online sometime between us hitting 'drastic climate catastrophe' and 'civilization ending climate catastrophe'.

Hull maintenance is a solvable problem.  Economic studies come after we can walk.  Similarly, actually realizable designs that can reach Lawson performance necessary for p+B11 won’t come before designs that can reach D+T are made.There are compelling narratives around funding, but ultimately it seems they are simultaneously overly optimistic about our technical advancement and overly jaded about future prospects.It’s important to note that there 	willis936	5.112918	0.95173913	comment	3.0	22.0	1566602762	-8.643633

All the reactor designs worked on in mainstream research would destroy themselves in a short time by high-energy neutron flux.Fusion research is, instead, a jobs program for high-neutron flux physicists, to provide a pool to draw on for weapons work.There are interesting commercial projects for designs that do not suffer from high neutron flux, such as those pursuing pB reactions. I read of another where neutrons are emitted in a place some distance from where the expensive machine parts are.You can tell if a fusion process is serious by whether they have an answer to the neutron problem.

Compare to a commercial PWR, in which (thermal power)/(volume of reactor vessel) is about 20 MW/m^3.   An order of magnitude worse than that would be 2 MW/m^3.  The (thermal power)/(reactor volume) for ITER is about 0.05 MW/m^3.

For reasons.The energy density of the plasma is necessarily so low that a useful power plant would be absolutely monstrous. Then, it would destroy itself with neutron flux in short order, leaving thousands of tons of radioactive scrap. There is no possibility of such a plant being competitive with solar and wind at current prices, and they are still on their way down.The prospect of commercial power generation is not the driver of fusion research. Rather, it is a jobs program for high neutron flux physicists, to maintain a population available to draw upon for weapons work.

That being said, I'm not convinced this will ever happen for these reasons:1. Energy loss from neutron loss. So-called ""aneutronic fusion"" seeks to avoid this problem but requires rare fuels (eg He-3), which kind of defeats the point. Also, it's not neutron free. It's just fewer neutrons;2. Container destruction from neutrons (ie ""neutron embrittlement""); and3. A superheated plasma (in either a tokamak or stellerator) is fundamentally a turbulent fluid. This is inherently unstable.

More precisely, it would have substantially less commercial viability than fission, which today lacks it. If we got to Q=1000, we would have viability that might match fission. Viability better than fission is not possible with hot-neutron fusion.Thus, hot-neutron fusion is a dead end. It might be that things learned chasing hot-neutron fusion will turn out to be useful for something else, such as aneutronic fusion. But work on aneutronic fusion, itself, would be overwhelmingly more useful. Very little work is being done on aneutronic fusion.	ncmncm	5.1130986	0.94866055	comment	4.0	19.0	1648648498	-8.702254

Somewhere between Q=5 and Q=10 you could extract more heat than you put in. The heat produced by the reactions should be enough to sustain the reaction.

I mean even it succeeds, then what?Here's the truth: there's no such thing as free energy. Even if the fuel is so abundant it's actually or effectively free (eg deuterium), the energy isn't. Say it takes $50B to build a plant that produces 1GW of power, which I'll estimate at about 7TWh/year based on [1]. Let's also say it has a lifespan of 40 years and an annual maintenance cost of $1B going to up to $2B in the last 10 years.So that's 40 years for 280TWh at a cost of $100B, which equates to $0.35/kWh if my math is correct.I realize ITER isn't a commercial power generation project.

12929730	Fusion produces energetic neutrons, 	Fusion produces energetic neutrons, and energetic neutrons are a very good way to make things radioactive. So all the popular approaches create waste that is more radioactive than fission waste, and probably comparable in volume.The only up side is that the decay products have a shorter half life. So the waste will only be a problem for a century or so, instead of for millennia.This may be better than fission, but it's definitely not clean by any realistic definition of the word.

The line about not being thermonuclear and the description of the device in question (a sphere with lasers) points towards an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device.  Most of the fusion research eggs are in the thermonuclear basket, specifically magnetic confinement fusion.  It is good to research a diverse set of approaches, but there are more engineering challenges to ICF reactors than there are to MCF reactors.  Pulses on the order of 1-2 Hz requires a mechanical system that can cycle out the exhaust and replace the pellet in that time.  Going to reactor scales also requires high load thermal cycles.  MCF ain’t easy, and brings it’s own engineering challenges.

Both would be complementing each other, rather than being a replacement.Solar and wind are comparatively cheap and quick to deploy and are great solutions for decentralised power generation. Wherever reliable continuous power is required, however, other methods of power generation have to step in. This could also still change of course, depending on how storage technology progresses. But the cheap super-battery is probably just as ambitious as fusion power is today.	qayxc	5.11344	0.9545876	comment	5.0	18.0	1671386890	9.833015

The plasma didn't touch the reactor walls, didn't destabilize, didn't crap out in any of the numerous other ways.

Add turbulence for something at 100 million degrees and I just don't see how that's viable.Inertial containment essentially wraps the fusing mass in something to absorb the neutrons.Still, even though exceeding the laser energy as direct energy output is significant, we're still nowhere near positive electricity output.

Most of the funding this field receives is motivated by checking models and constants for thermonuclear weapons.

By the eighties there was plenty of experimental evidence to describe the relationships between tokamak parameters and power output. Particularly that the gain is proportional to the radius to the power of 1.3 and the magnetic field cubed.

Fission is relatively trivial: just put special rocks in a grid and pump water over them as they pour out their star energy.Progress is good and exciting, but I don't see any re	acidburnNSA	5.110359	0.9757116	comment	9.0	204.0	1670858426	-8.480473

For example, not meeting the same level of hydrogen loading in the metal matrix.It could all absolutely be BS, but I was surprised that it wasn’t actually proven to be BS; it was just not proven to not be BS, and was then made “embarrassing”.	mordymoop	5.133695	0.9245162	comment	9.0	83.0	1616453531	-8.743588

32759598	And the engineering here is very pro	And the engineering here is very problematic.  Indeed, the issue mentioned may be a showstopper for DT fusion.The problem is limits on power/area through the wall of the reactor.  Because all the produced energy has to go through the wall, and because the area of the wall grows as r^2, the volumetric power density of a DT reactor (that doesn't exceed the power/area limit on the wall) must decline with increasing size.This leads to DT fusion reactors having horrible volumetric power density.  ITER, for example, has a volumetric gross fusion power density of 0.05 MW/m^3.  The 2014 ARC design, 0.5 MW/m^3.  A PWR's reactor vessel?  20 MW/m^3.(If you look at the power density of the plasma alone, or the fission reactor core alone, you get similar wildly discrepant numbers:  https://cpb-us-w2.wp	pfdietz	5.1103063	0.9558503	comment	12.0	113.0	1662598418	-8.617882

Fission will likely not improve on either of those compared to fission reactors now being developed.If we can't can't get a Molten Salt reactor with a CO2 Brayton Cycles turbine into commercial deployment, I have little hope for Fusion.And if we do, then its hard to see how Fusion reactors beats it on price.That said, I want	nickik	5.107501	0.9601906	comment	14.0	106.0	1614971497	-8.637153

So, if you want to build a multiple MW fusion plant, shouldn't these plants be ridiculously huge compared to, say, a wind turbine rated at a couple of MW?Is the density of the plasma so much higher in a fusion reactor?Also, something else I never grokked, how do you get the power out? The plasma heats up, but how do you turn that into useful electrical energy?Nevertheless of course I hope it does work as advertised... someday.Edit: thanks everyone for the thoughtful, insightful replies!	isoprophlex	5.1373334	0.9331778	comment	14.0	75.0	1601402941	-8.65697

28464629	You are right, people who flippantly	You are right, people who flippantly dismiss fusion just don't understand it.-Fusion has made consistent improvement, roughly in line with expectations for the level of investment (20 years away predictions were considering if we invested massively, which we did not).- Fusion is in theory something that could give us true energy abundance. Want to just desalinate water like crazy? Want to extract gigatons of carbon? Working fusion enables these to happen woth existing technologies.I like to think of solar, batteries, fission, and wind as compelling ways to go mostly carbon free and lower energy costs about 2x over the next 20 years or so.Fusion is what reduces energy cost potentially another 10x, which really changes the game for lots of things. Exciting stuff. Kudos to this team.	mchusma	5.1132026	0.95336825	comment	14.0	163.0	1631146422	-8.604818

I understand that we need to develop better storage technologies for the energy produced by wind and solar, but that seems so much easier than the challenges currently facing fusion. Wind and solar just seem so far ahead of fusion already - they're pretty cheap and very widely deployed on a global scale. In comparison fusion seems very expensive and unproven and even when we get everything to work it might not be much better than a solar farm with a big battery pack. But maybe I'm missing something important about the economics?	brofallon	5.1076574	0.95577997	comment	14.0	65.0	1670951871	-8.610454

And as well no chance commercially proven fusion will exist even on a minimal scale before electricity needs are fully covered by renewables.
Continuing fusion research is important to keep the scientific process going, it will surely result in a lot of byproduct discoveries in physics, material science, and a lot more, but the lie about fusion-derived electricity as being a viable and/or necessary thing for humankind, should stop."	anovikov	5.1177287	0.9548659	comment	14.0	77.0	1697270649	-8.623255

Solar costs are going down massively. Hydro is dirt cheap already. So renewables can absolutely be part of an energetic transition in the near future, while fusion is at best many decades away. So while I think fusion energy has the potential to transform energy generation, and by extent everything about our life, it's wrong to assume renewables aren't probably our safest bet in the near future.Also there's something amusing about ""Here's my sure assessment.

The government needs to maintain a population of cleared scientists who know how to calculate things like fusion yields, simulated with classified codes. These fake fusion energy programs contribute to that; some of the most capable scientists don’t want to work on weapons, so they can kid themselves that they are working on “energy”.There is no reasonably foreseeable future with fusion as part of the electricity grid. Even if we got fantastically lucky and were able to build a practical (magnetic or inertial) reactor in 50 years, by that time improvements in energy storage and transmission technologies will have allowed renewable energy to dominate, and no government  would be crazy enough to permit it	leephillips	5.1141186	0.9553577	comment	16.0	157.0	1629229047	-8.645784
