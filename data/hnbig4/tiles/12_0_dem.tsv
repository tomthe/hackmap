Which if I understand correctly the Topics API fixes. But the article implies that these are minor problems that we never really cared that much about.Whether it is this or constant aggressive writing, it seems that the goal of this blog post is to simply inspire anger and hate, while not furthering the discussion on the topic.

The migration of content into walled gardens like Instagram seems more likely to me.	xnx	7.8334665	-7.706825	comment	14.0	96.0	1618603871	-14.491814
