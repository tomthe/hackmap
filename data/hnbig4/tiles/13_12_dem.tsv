It can definitely help by increasing gear stiffness.However 3D printing with fiberglass causes rapid nozzle wear, and recently people are saying that fiberglass reinforced 3D printing filaments represent a human hazard.Since I’ve managed to get my gears to work without reinforcement, I’ve not tried it.One thing I do with printed gears is make the gear teeth much larger than would be strictly needed in an injection molded solution. This lets me deal with reduced material performance compared to injection molding.	TaylorAlexander	9.7396145	6.3197403	comment	3.0	10.0	1581558441	-5.4196935

I am very much in the pro-inverter camp. In an inverter microwave, power is supplied through an inverter circuit to supply a steady and constant amount of power throughout the cooking time without cutting in and out. So if you select 50% power, the microwave will deliver 50% power throughout.

The net result is a drop in the number of riders, which has an impact on overall safety.I came to this article thinking it would be BS but it turns out to be quite reasonable. Yes, helmets protect rider and all riders should wear one; but making helmets mandatory have unintended consequences which result, as a whole, in making bikes less safe for everyone.	bambax	9.7210655	6.8768835	comment	3.0	63.0	1670237469	-6.6605067

The data is rather clear on that, oddly.  The article even linked to the study they are basing that on at https://usa.streetsblog.org/2015/02/27/safety-in-numbers-bik....Do we know the full causal factors?  I'd wager not.

If you want evidence that biking without a helmet is perfectly safe - there you go. A case study done by an entire country with 18 million inhabitants for a period of 100+ years.Bike safety is an infrastructure problem. Nothing else.Wearing a helmet will not make up for bad infrastructure - biking with bad infrastructure and a helmet is still incredibly dangerous. After you have good infrastructure, biking is already safe, especially when you use a Dutch bike that forces you to sit upright [1] making it far less likely you will fall on your head.Wearin	mytherin	9.763399	6.8514543	comment	3.0	10.0	1670442972	-6.670685

LED's cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10 every decade (see Haitz's Law), while a user's actual lighting needs may never exceed 800 lumens for an standard A19 bulb.

Far from a cartel, we should let the government create a standardized LED lifespan rating based on the actual needs of consumers. For example, if we know the average renovation cycle for single family houses in the US is ten years, then we should make LED bulbs that are rated for 10 years.

You see they're having a nice sale on a box of a dozen croissants, and their croissants are the best in the city. So do you:- Grab a couple boxes, and a reusable bag to carry them in?- Walk 15 minutes home to get your bag, then 15 minutes back, then 15 minutes back home (45 minutes total) just so you don't pay $3 for a bag?- Carry around a bag all the time even though you had no intention to buy anything when you left, and use it only a few times over the hundreds of time you leave your apartment?	bane	9.866443	6.1870236	comment	3.0	20.0	1707065468	-1.0429355

But for that kind of cooking I use the gas BBQ outside mostly.Having bought an induction stove when refitting our kitchen, then replacing it with a different one a couple of months later, I can advise that the size of the elements matters.

Last Friday, Netherland was 3rd in the number of medals (since overtaken by the US, I just noticed), and all of them are for speed skating. I don't think there's any country where speed skating has so professionalised as here. And that's what Nils van der Poel had to go up against, on his own.From what I understand, he and silver medalist Patrick Roest are long-time rivals, even during youth championships often coming first and second.

Manufacturers should be liable for parts and labor and upgrades if their fixture buzzes with a dimmer that's licensed for sale in the state.

The security mechanism was not only that it was ugly, but the 3-speed shifter mechanism was messed up and the pedals only worked if you had it just so between 2nd and 3rd gear, sort of halfway in between, otherwise the pedals would slip if you stood up on them or put much pressure on them. I never locked it. I would just put it in 1st gear and walk away. On campus I don't think anyone tried to swipe it except I noticed a few times it was laying on the ground instead of the bike rack.

And this gives you a lot more control, especially at lower temperatures.

Most flicker horribly on playback, including the expensive Cree bulbs.The built-in LED spotlights that came with my house flicker like a rave concert whenever I capture a video in slo-mo. It's unsettling.Phillips LEDs, especially the Scene Switch bulbs, are flicker-free according to my tests. Surprisingly, older CFL bulbs flicker much less than LEDs.	copperx	9.630945	6.2822165	comment	3.0	12.0	1544416470	8.023728

The inside portions of thicker foods are mainly heated by heat conducted from the outer portions.I think the main reason this myth persists is stuffed/filled food items such as pizza rolls, burritos, Pop Tarts, Hot Pockets, etc.. With these, there's typically an outer layer that is thermally insulating and lower-density, while the filling is more thermally conductive and higher-density (water/fat). This means that even if the temperature is uniform, the filling will be perceived as much hotter than the outer layer.	0xcde4c3db	9.029149	6.118509	comment	3.0	11.0	1529034544	10.921162

So it's not strange that given the option to get better color rendering at a good price, LED technology using full spectrum light has been prefferd.However, there's nothing stopping us from using LED lights with warmer spectrum, and that argument is probably good to raise.

In fact, in general, longer wavelength radio waves are often transmitted at higher power than shorter.Unless they mean that this microwave energy transfer scheme itself is using more energetic radio waves than other types of radio systems... but it doesn't read that way to me.	packet_nerd	9.11818	6.103913	comment	3.0	14.0	1599677429	6.011581

Response is literally instant because the pot is the source of heat, and not something external. They are also by far the safest since the hottest thing in the entire system is the bottom of the pot, which is usually at about 100-200 C depending on what you're cooking, which is usually not hot enough to start a fire. Compare to a electric stove whose element reaches upwards of 800 C or a gas stove which has an actual open flame which can easily catch nearby flammable vapors, hair, or clothing on fire if not careful.Gas stoves are the next most responsive because the fire doesn't ""store"" heat; only the grill does.Finally electric stoves are the slowest-responding because the coil "	dheera	9.519457	6.16151	comment	3.0	14.0	1600627696	-12.383146

If you want 50% effect, it runs 5 seconds, then wait 5 seconds. Cooking it on low is just letting the food distribute the heat naturally for a while, instead of building up an energy bubble that will expload in steam. So low effect is good. It's still max effect but on half the time.When cooking oatmeal porridge I usually do one cup oatmeal and 2 cups and a little more of water. In deep plate, full effect in microwave for 2 minutes but I watch it the whole time. When it starts building a volcano I let it go on until the edges of the volcano goes to the edge of the plate. THen everything is nicely cooked and I stuff my butter and a bit of salt in there and stir it until it's the thickness I want.	Moru	8.897958	6.1257052	comment	3.0	16.0	1601721465	11.110676

LED lights use a constant current power supply (often called a driver in this context) that regulates the voltage applied to the LEDs to achieve their rated current. Unfortunately, several failure modes can cause the driver to continuously cycle.This is a problem I've frequently encountered with household LED lighting.What I don't understand is why modern houses aren't set up with a central, high quality ""driver"" with adequate cooling to convert AC to a steady DC current, then wire that to light outlets so you only need the LED itself there.

Sodium lamps have the worst color rendering of any bulb. They produce a dark yellow glow which is generally a very low quality light. Additionally, there are serious waste disposal issues with sodium lamps. In particular, they have been known to start fires in the event that the lamp is broken and the sodium metal is exposed. The sodium can catch fire even in the event that the lamp is broken on the ground. For this reason it is safest to break sodium lights under water and then to subsequently dispose of the destroyed bulb.

The peloton breaks up because the critical limit is the performance envelop of the bike's steering geometry, braking and contact patches. It's not that aerodynamics don't matter at all, it's that good enough is good enough. The margins are elsewhere. Everyone can go fast enough to carry too much speed into a turn and have a bad day.Other positions...provide more equal distribution of body weight over both wheelsThis is a suspect optimization premise. Weight distributed to the rear wheel means less weight on the steering wheel and greater eccentric forces when steering...i.e. a reduced front wheel contact patch required to resist higher eccentric loads.An interesting difference between the photogr	brudgers	9.722186	6.6380897	comment	3.0	15.0	1592144044	10.607634

The quicker you cycled, the more power you gave to the bulb and the brighter it was. But it was based on some microcontroller and the light bulb’s brightness was not proportional to how fast you cycled. It has like 3 preprogrammed brightness. It completely failed to give kids the intuition of the physics behind the phenomenon.Anyway, it’s probably an unfair comparison but I like having the real deal when learning or teaching.	ibizaman	9.849509	6.1094985	comment	3.0	11.0	1692909461	7.5043874

When I go for a jog wanting to listen to podcasts, battery status, headphones, Bluetooth and playlist ordering are additional complexities that, at the very minimum, add additional steps to the process and, at worst, require several minutes of problem-solving before I can get started.In my experience, involving a smartphone can, but rarely does, make things simpler."	cseleborg	9.88352	6.622265	comment	3.0	11.0	1693639018	-5.6146617

The separation will happen after the compression force is removed, because the compression will keep the split parts close together. Meaning that the helmet falls apart after it's done the job.Also, there are various degrees of helmets, from a simple polystyrene to a mountain bike one to a motorcycle helmet.You can always go to the next level if you want more protection. The polystyrene one is not supposed to be the end all of protection, just to be better than nothing with minimal inconvenience.	323	9.709968	6.8518906	comment	3.0	58.0	1653236102	-6.572763

I hit the side of the van put a big dent in it and fractured my clavicle and t6 and had several cuts in my face. The helmet I was wearing was completely disintegrated on the side I hit the car with. Fortunately I was visiting Australia were cycling helmets were mandatory, back in Europe were i was living normally i would not have worn one.Since then I always were a helmet when out training. However I don't wear a helmet when dropping off the kids with my cargo bike. It's true that drivers are more aggressive towards helmet wearers, moreover I can't think of an accident where a helmet would help when I'm on the cargo bike.	cycomanic	9.719947	6.863399	comment	3.0	20.0	1653237463	-6.56276

Luckily, I've never hit my helmet/head when coming off so I've found that a bike helmet is most useful for stopping low branches etc from hitting me.

Sampling an accelerometer at kHz rates as a helmet is vibrating (without translating all of the vibrational energy into the head), will measure larger peak G's than the head experiences.For this reason, when studying head impact for football players, they mount the accelerometers in the mouth guard. This more accurately reflects the real g-forces, as the teeth (ideally) don't move much relative to the brain during an impact, and have the appropriate reference frame.The differences can be extremely large. The peaks reflected in this graph are absolutely not real and should not be taken literally.	etrautmann	9.691184	6.852342	comment	3.0	22.0	1595822647	3.4917698

Instead of spreading the light emission out over a couple of dozen LEDs, it's cheaper to use a handful of LEDs but really overdrive them with high currents.The result is a bulb that's cheap to make, but in ordinary use the chips and phosphors inside will run at high temperatures and degrade much more quickly.

Beyond that, the statistics become much less meaningful.Consumers typically don't read colour temperature ratings (in black-body Kelvin), but instead follow ""warm white / soft white / cool white"" descriptors.  Even still, it's common to see homes with temperature-mismatched lighting.CRI is a step worse.  It is a higher-is-better indicator, but there's no intuitive connection for a consumer.  Is a CRI of 80 bad?  Is 95 better enough to be worth double the price?

I have literally a house full of LED bulbs, some of which are on dimmers, and have experienced literally none of these problems. Just for starters, I haven't had a single LED bulb fail in the 8-odd years I've been using them in my home.But maybe there's an argument that you have to pay a significant premium to get a bulb that doesn't have the issues you've run into and, once you factor that premium into account, LED bulbs aren't worth it. But some of the broad claims here, and in the article, about the allegedly poor performance of LED bulbs just don't cohere at all with my experience with them.

It breaks even after 7 rides, and they have at least 20 rides in them before they're toast.I haven't factored in other parts of the economy, like oversupply, theft, premature damage, and payroll for the employees including chargers, but seeing they're in 100 cities with at least 3 million scooters on 	kawfey	9.927781	6.805332	comment	4.0	15.0	1537539230	3.6739628

I slammed on my brakes, and went over the handlebars only a few inches before hitting the car. I landed on the road with my hip and my head whiplashed over into the road. If I hadn't been wearing a helmet I would undoubtedly have fractured my skull, and possible worse. Since then I've been a vocal proponent of helmets - in London - because this accident was nothing to do with my riding. I had a front light on, a reflective vest and light-coloured clothing.The real issue for me is cycling infrastructure. London is getting sort-of better. There are cycle ""superhighways"", but they're quite narrow and have their fair share of idiot cyclists who ride very fast"	frereubu	9.748024	6.860218	comment	4.0	31.0	1538876673	-6.6025505

If Bird and Lime have gotten unpopular, a “Bird for Bikes” would probably make people livid.- Honestly, the fact that Birds and Limes come with Anti-theft mechanisms and GPS transponders (which run on the same battery as the motor I think) makes them a bit harder to steal (and there aren’t easily removable parts or a viable black market for selling them).

To add to the complexity, directives like EnergyStar are aiming for power factor >0.9 in lighting above 3W. Maintaining high power factor (sin^2 input power) while having low lighting ripple (constant output power) requires some method of of storing energy. In methods 1,2,3 (and 4 depending), neither high power factor nor good lighting ripple is achieved, but very low cost is.Note that this info is for fairly low power LEDs. When you start having high power LEDs, regulations may require better power electronics, and the cost of the electronics might be amortized against the cost of the thermal cooling solution, etc, so you can make a more expensive electronics 	sephamorr	9.689457	6.2533894	comment	4.0	15.0	1544419094	7.9956646

The standard diagonal shoulder belt design allows your body to lean over sideways (towards the center of the car) if the roof of the vehicle caves in on your head and pushes you down.  If you're in a harness without a rollcage and the roof caves in, the harness locks your spine upright and you end up with a head/neck/spine injury that's very likely to be fatal.  This whole line of reasoning snowballs from there, because beyond that:If you do install a well-designed cage just so you can safely use a harness, now you also need to wear a helmet.

I'm a heavy bike user, and a lot of the situations where theft is likely are also ones where carrying a good lock can add significant friction to the activity. Things like running an errand a neighborhood over, beach, sports game, quick trip to grocery store, etc.And anyway a common wisdom I believe is that if someone targets your bike specifically they will have it. This (or any) doesn't have to be a better lock per se, it just needs to be no worse and not make your bike more of a target.I have no insight or really even educated guesses about the quality or value of this specific one though. It looks like 6ku or retrospec or something which cool I like those fine for city bikes.	giraffe_lady	9.917987	6.718844	comment	4.0	27.0	1646615641	3.7146294

Most of the health concerns are probably solved by requiring the installation of range hoods.I don't believe the claims about burning natural gas being the causal factor here either. I rather think that culprit is aerosolized oil, and houses with gas ranges are simply more likely to cook with oil at temperatures hot enough to aerosolize it. I think this conclusion is reasonable at least because people who like cooking also are more likely to be more comfortable with cooking at higher temperature, and also are more likely to prioritize cooking with gas when considering homes.The most salient argument against gas is not that it's worse than induction.

Ben Kuhn's approach was to buy a big 30k lumen LED bulb for $100. I am doing a more DIY approach with a number of small LED COBs. Each finished module will output 13.5k lumens for a bit less than $100 (so multiple will be needed per room), but it comes with a number of benefits:- The light is extremely high quality, almost the exact same as sunlight. Fluorescent bulbs and normal LEDs do not give off the full spectrum of visible light we get from the sun and incandescent bulbs.

They also heat sugars, fats, waxes, and can even efficiently heat some types of glass.Microwave ovens work on the principles of dielectric heating, not any form of resonance. The microwave radiation causes the molecules to rotate back and forth with the electric field to generate heat.

The rest of my transportation needs are neatly provided by electric light rail.How do you deal with doing groceries ? I have to do groceries for 5 people, have to actually cook for them about 14x a week, at, let's say, 150gr of food per person per meal, at 50% waste to allow for actual cooking, so let's say 150gr * 14 * (1/(1-50%))= 5 kilogram, plus stuff to drink. Humans drink about 1.5 liter per day. So all in all, I need the ability to carry some 25-40kg easily. How do I do that using light rail ?Note: going twice, by itself, increases the cost of groceries due to economies of scale. Going 5 times increases it by a lot, ignoring the lost time.

The trick is to start in summer, do it every day and just never stop for any weather, e.g. for your work or uni commute.Obviously you need something that protects you from occasional rain or at least some dry and clean clothes to change into, but apart from that, the seasonal change will not be harsh. It is usually gradual, and yes, you will at some point want to wear gloves, and long pants, at some point even long underwear (or specific biking clothes), but it is never suddenly cold. Actually you become less sensitive to the cold overall. At least that was my experience.To be fair, I stopped doing that a few years ago, since not having a shower at work makes slightly longer commutes uncomfortable 	bipson	9.917965	6.222126	comment	4.0	30.0	1501080325	3.6360075

I've fallen a few times, at high speeds too (rounding a corner that hasn't been de-iced ended with my hip getting closely aquatinted to the asphalt), reflexes seem to have taken care of protecting my head. I think they might offer some protecting in high speed accidents where even your body does not have time to turn your head away from the ground, but I think in those cases the chances of breaking your neck are just as high.

That is why you rarely see lights not working at Walmart anymore.They don't do it because they want all the lights to work. They do it because if they don't, it costs more in energy and the brightness goes down.Long life incandescents also put out less light per watt and end up using more energy as the bulb ages as well as the light decreasing.

I know some people say you should put hot water in it so it doesn't cook the coffee as long but on induction it boils in seconds anyway.I used to have the classic aluminium one because I prefer the geometric shape but I switched to stainless steel when I got induction and it seems higher quality in general.I enjoy the ritual personally, it's my favorite way to make coffee.	chpatrick	9.4416485	6.165014	comment	4.0	17.0	1706005811	-12.36889

The article suggests the city ultimately adopted 3000K lamps, but it definitely feels like the pilot program used 4000K ones, they looked very cool.Another interesting development with these so-called ""smart lights"" [1] is that the city can potentially modulate brightness on a street-by-street basis, and asking different neighborhoods to weigh in on where they want the lamps to be brighter (or maybe, if they want them dimmer on side streets etc). This sounds like a very good change - customizing street lights based on neighborhood requirements is a very nice"	60654	9.691096	6.2648244	comment	4.0	29.0	1492825733	7.90556

It's especially bad in the United States.It's impossible to prepare a good tasty meal with a microwave. And oven-ready food is garbage. You can't even re-heat most of your left overs properly. Ever tried to re-heat a slice of pizza in a microwave? Use a skillet or a grill, and it's as good as new.Cooking real tasty food requires many many tools (most of which have been used for many centuries), a lot of ingredients and skill. It's an art form, essentially. And a couple decades ago, everybody knew how to do it.	nom	8.993021	6.123505	comment	4.0	16.0	1495342916	11.011318

My rating started to get lower as the cultural expectation to tip cash took hold.It turns out the Lyft model, where the driver doesn't know whether or not the rider tipped, is better for the rider.  The rider doesn't have to carry cash in order to avoid getting extorted for a 5-star rating.Tipping culture in restaurants is subsidizing substandard wages for servers.  Tipping culture for taxis and the gypsy cab apps (Uber, Didi, Lyft, etc) doesn't have to take hold.  Maybe now that the option is in-app, riders will eventually stop using it.I hope, at least, that the tipping option is confined to U.S. rides.

The pans are specially designed to contain a heating coil in them which implicitly is closer to your food.It also means the work surface tends to cool quickly (or never get hot in the first place), making it safer.	mankyd	9.527048	6.164832	comment	4.0	16.0	1673454008	-12.378616

I get that point. And the other points made here about defense against traffic and cars. But helmets protect against WAY more than getting hit by a truck. They protect you when your foot gets stuck and you fall over backwards onto concrete. They protect you when you flip over and the bike comes back around and the chain ring takes a chunk out of the helmet instead of your head. Helmets stop injuries and many other ways."	blakesterz	9.709755	6.860345	comment	4.0	19.0	1674000954	-6.5833917

It really depends on the design, but the general idea is that the filter capacitor will help prevent spikes and other issues caused by the failing LED. It can also help with voltage regulation.---Actual answer: Light bulb needs a bulky electrolytic cap. Those are usually not 400V tolerant. You are looking at 60V at best at the required sizes. Losing the load will swiftly charge up the capacitor to 325V.

There should really only be one main button that you press: “quick cook/add 30” that auto starts it. No one has a valid use case for setting their microwave to run for 1:37. Multiples of 30 are all the granularity you need.Some companies get this right but others it’s astounding how many buttons you have to press to get the damn thing to start. I very much enjoy my current microwave which has a quick start button which is also knob. So you poke it and it just goes, but once running you can granularity adjust time up or down by turning the knob. Very satisfying.	appplication	9.097546	6.172308	comment	5.0	23.0	1698330081	10.9242735

33498044	If you want to have a range of brigh	If you want to have a range of brightness you have a couple of options. One option is to vary the voltage you supply to the led, leading to a reduced brightness at lower voltages. The alternative is to use pulse width modulation, basically turning the led on and off fast so that it is on for a percentage of the time at full power.Going with lower voltage is less efficient as the LED will output less light per voltage but not linearly, it will still use most of the power of full brightness at half.Choosing PWM allows you to skip this problem by keeping the voltage identical but by using human persistence of vision to get the ideal number of photons to your eyes per your perception frame. The problem comes from making a slow PWM signal, say 60Hz, or having two similar but not identical PWM s	rowinofwin	9.649001	6.2661514	comment	5.0	26.0	1667773130	7.952209

27879923	The unresponsiveness of controls dri	The unresponsiveness of controls drive me nuts as well. Greasy or wet fingers makes it hard to use the controls. This is solvable with physical knobs.Also the power moves up and down in steps, induction alternates between on and off to deliver an average amount of power. With gas knobs you have more fine grained control. When you want to fry something, with induction you often have 2 power options: the “fry, cook, fry, cook” option and the “fry just a bit too hard” option. I have debuyer pans, made of thick metal, acting as a buffer, which helps a bit.Stepless controll, with physical knobs would help a lot.Induction stoves are great for cooking water though. And for cleaning.	BozeWolf	9.4484215	6.177161	comment	5.0	24.0	1626677568	-12.368766

I don't believe ratings (especially Uber ratings) are meaningful at all because it's either five star or you're fired, and as a customer you pay the same rate for terrible service as you do for excellent service. I don't believe tips are an excuse for getting around the base fare in this case or for avoiding min wage laws.Being able to easily tip a driver for exceptional service is great, makes me feel better as a customer, and provides an incentive for drivers beyond stars. What's the harm in making it easy if your base rate is the same? As long as it's not an expectation I think it works quite well.	sailfast	8.954832	7.3022594	comment	5.0	19.0	1492462588	-15.280974

You can see this by putting your saucepan with water to 350, then lowering it to 212 when it reaches a boil. It will rapidly cycle between boiling and not boiling, making simmering very difficult. My particular induction burner has one setting for 140F (way too low) and the next setting is 212F. Where's simmer?It does heat water up faster than a conventional burner, so I use it for cooking the pasta while I make the sauce on a conventional gas stovetop.

A lot of lamps are more or less closed and heat up as a whole.

the spectrum but it's still really strange, with missing bits. When
fluorescent lights first became popular people complained of headaches

Most of the wear and tear that leads to burnouts in incandescent light bulbs is caused by turning them on and off, not by burning them. Each time the bulb is turned on and off, the filament is heated and cooled. This causes the material of the filament to expand and contract, in turn causing micro stress cracks to develop. The more the light is turned on and off, the larger these cracks grow, until eventually the filament breaks at some point, in non-spectacular fashion, thus causing the light to burn out.I knew running filament bulbs on low voltage is the key to their longevity, but this is another impor	rex_lupi	9.671418	6.2604895	comment	6.0	31.0	1691485879	7.98701

21330707	One interesting property of LEDs com	One interesting property of LEDs compared to many other lighting technologies is that they can be turned on and off very quickly.Suppose you made all your LED lights so that they alternated 2.08333 ms on, 2.08333 ms off. That's a 240 Hz flicker rate, which should be high enough that it won't bother people.Further, suppose you synchronized the flicker of all the lights in a city so that they were all on at the same time, and all off at the same time.Finally, suppose you made some goggles that had a shutter system opened for 1.5625 ms out of every 4.16667 ms, and synchronized it with the LED flickering so that the shutter opens 0.520833 ms after the LEDs start their off phase. The shutter will then be closing just as the LEDs turn on.By the time the shutter opens, the LEDs will have been off	tzs	9.644955	6.2897987	comment	6.0	28.0	1571800280	7.949045

And for racing bicycles wearing a helmet is the norm.A helmet can significantly reduce the impact of a fall, but the risk of that fall is so low that the measure becomes statistically meaningless.

The earliest we found was Season 2 of Boy Meets World (1993) though there was a lively debate about whether the early seasons of Married with Children had a microwave or a toaster oven.

I installed dimmer switches in each room of my house and bought LED bulbs that get redder when dimmed (like incandescent bulbs naturally do). I turn on the lights when I walk into a room, turn them down when it gets dark outside, and turn them off when I leave or go to sleep.To those who do find value in WiFi-connected bulbs: what makes them worth it to you? I'm genuinely curious, because if Home Depot's lightbulb aisle is any indication I'm the odd one.	lolinder	9.673507	6.2352633	comment	6.0	23.0	1695781679	7.824852

Without knowing GE's reasons let's brainstorm:- My first thought is that many light bulbs are not easily accessible. They could be high up, or in a casing that requires a tool to open. So being able to reset them remotely is a practical benefit.- If you google ""accidents whilst changing light bulb"" it seems that it's not impossible to injure or even kill yourself whilst changing a light bulb. So minimising the amount of times you need to physically access a light bulb has safety benefits.- It is possible that the bulb is turned off but the power to it is still on.

Somehow, no one noticed when mine was snatched one evening. I was pretty devastated.My grandfather drove me around the town the next day to see if I could spot it. When we were about to give up, I noticed a bike leaning along side a house near the shop. I could see it from the street. It looked exactly like mine. It had the same replacement seat and even a curly bike lock coiled around the handlebars on the same side I left it. But it had been hastily spray pained.We called the police, they arrived and a kid inside noticed the commotion and came out. They had found the bike at the shop and took it. I went to inspect it.

Unfortunately of 3 categories of information needed for an informed decision (lifetime, power usage, and light output) purchasers only had a good measure of how often they replaced bulbs.

This has lead to a much more pleasant riding experience, especially in winter. They aren't very practical on a regular bike as they make you uncomfortably hot, but on an e-bike, it's much less of a worry.	alkjsdlkjasd	9.933753	6.297022	comment	7.0	77.0	1679320999	3.6248355

The reason cameras perceive the flicker is that they take discrete samples, with an (electronic or optical) shutter in between. This creates a beat frequency with things that also flicker, in effect “tuning into” a HF flicker and “lowering it” into the visible range, the same way a superheterodyne radio tunes into a HF carrier wave and brings it down into the audible range.	derefr	9.640171	6.282185	comment	7.0	31.0	1582128065	7.98864

Longer wavelengths can penetrate food more deeply.It's called RF solid state cooking. It uses radio frequency as a heat source. It allows for much higher precision (compared to traditional speed cooking methods that combine microwave technology and traditional oven elements) due to the RF signals providing a feedback loop. They respond back and help the oven understand and target specific zones within the cooking cavity.Hence the name: “Dialog”By regulating the oven’s heat in one place, you can cook the fish while the ice stays frozen.

So you take a LED light, strap a bulky AC/DC convertor to it, then also glue in a WiFi module, and also some microcontroller for managing all that stuff. Then you cram all that into E27 fitting and have problems with heat dissipation if your LED is actually about as bright as an old 100W lamp was: the capacitors give out after a couple of months of work so you have to buy a new lightbulb (and those things ain't cheap because of all of that additional stuff it has inside it).Obviously, a sane way to do things would be to have a single microcontroller/WiFi module mounted near/inside any of traditional manual light switches, have a single AC/DC convertor near your circuit breaker box, and have it power the whole lighting wiring (from which the 	Joker_vD	9.679379	6.234295	comment	8.0	39.0	1628256611	7.955721

Shitty ones with twice the frequency of the main current (so 100/120 Hz) While you might not notice this it causes eye strain and can lead to eye fatigue, headaches, migraines.2. Most LEDs have a low CRI (Color Rendering Index, or called Ra which is one standard to measure it), this means that they do not emit light in certain frequencies causing objects to look dull/gray. Most LED lamps have a Ra value of 80, meaning that they emit on average in the 80% of a spectrum that covers most of the visible light.If you loo	sydd	9.638473	6.2674594	comment	9.0	66.0	1544432481	7.9845176

From the article:> A major cause of head injuries is going over the handlebars, which is not possible with a 3 metre long bike. Another thing that makes us unique is our training systems, maintenance systems, and ability to track poor rider behaviour.Made me curious what they actually look like[0].Seeing that, I’d tend to reset my presumptions about wearing helmets with these. There’s definitely going to be a different injury profile with these bikes than the bikes you rode as a kid.

On the whole, I am not sure that a man who takes his pleasure overhauling does not have the best of the bargain. He is independent of the weather and the wind; the state of the roads troubles him not. Give him a screw-hammer, a bundle of rags, an oil-can, and something to sit down upon, and he is happy for the day. He has to put up with certain disadvantages, of course; there is no joy without alloy. He himself always looks like a tinker, and his machine always suggests the idea that, having stolen it, he has tried to disguise it; but as he rarely gets beyond the first milestone with it, this, perhaps, does not much matter.

Uber/DoorDash/Lyft are all pretty simple CRUD apps at their core, and the companies themselves do very little actual work.

Restaurants are stuck with them due to vendor lock-in, and they have to cut their margins or raise prices as a result.

This may be the motor, which may survive being jammed indefinitely, or it could burn up, causing a more expensive problem. In a mixer, the motor is probably decently powerful and doesn't tolerate being jammed.If there's enough gear reduction, then a jam can develop enough force to bend shafts or break mountings and other components. That can make the product impossible to repair, if some injection molded bit that was supposed to hold stuff in place was broken.A well placed plastic gear that breaks and saves the rest of the mechanism can make repair far easier and cheaper.

We have a similar problem of trying to protect our delivery assets (though not nearly as bad as the plight of the gig workers in the article given that our workers can count on the coop and also because Montreal is generally safer than NYC).Our threat vectors are a bit different in that the bikes are more likely to be snatched when the rider is dismounted and in a building for a pickup or delivery. We’ve been experimenting by keeping a GPS in the frame and triggering something akin to a car alarm when the bike starts moving too significantly while the rider’s phone isn’t in the vicinity of the bike.Our primary challenge h	Gaessaki	9.925018	6.688656	comment	10.0	43.0	1632131471	3.6140397

The claimed lifetime (based on accelerated aging tests) is as good as for LEDs.The low efficiency is solved by using a lossless optical filter (i.e. one that transmits the visible light and reflects back the infrared light) to prevent the heat loss from the lamp by radiation other than the useful light ou	adrian_b	9.680711	6.255728	comment	11.0	80.0	1681511118	7.96605

Technically you could also do this for times like 2:65 instead of 3:05 but at that point you're not saving a keystroke.

This flicker is known to cause additional eye fatigue and can trigger headaches in many.What's worse is that many aftermarket LED headlights are now u	mastercheif	9.653508	6.3008857	comment	12.0	89.0	1676562241	7.9177136

30025735	As I understand it, electric kettles	As I understand it, electric kettles never became as popular in the United States (though of course they do exist) because the electrical standards here mean that it's infeasible to make one that works really well -- a British electric kettle might be rated at 3,000 W (about 13 A at 230 V), but a standard U.S. convenience outlet can only provide about 1,800 W (15 A, 120 V). Even the higher-rated 20 amp outlets are only going to get you 2,400 watts. To get 3,000 watts, you'd either need a special circuit (like the ones for RV hookups), or plug it into a dryer or electric range outlet.

Note that this is a different test than the ones used to prove that MIPS was better than a styrofoam helmet.The real story is that marketing probably has a bigger influence than science in this case.

There was a picture of a rollerblader in a skating mag and they photoshopped pink makeup on his face and made his rollerblades purple.Skaters started calling rollerblades ""fruit boots"" and that killed it for a lot of people who didn't want to associated with something seen as weak and ""gay""."

Apple has lots of issues like this, in iOS and macOS, where they choose visual appeal over functionality, or where animation impedes usability.This is a pretty sad bug, though.My (very expensive, ""high-end"") Japanese induction stove has a similar issue. Its capacitive touch controls take just an extra beat to register, so you have to turn on the stove, pause 700ms, turn on the burner, pause another 500ms or so, then turn the burner up to max to boil your kettle.I'm totally used to it by now, and never get it wrong any more, but it still bugs me every single fucking morning."	veidr	9.439978	6.180958	comment	14.0	99.0	1508815645	-12.324956

No need for each appliance to have different sorts of cables (mostly irreplaceable and fixed length) which don't fit some outlets correctly.Maybe after some regulations, it would even be easy to update the firmware of those home appliances to open source alternatives.	timenova	9.511649	6.120768	comment	18.0	107.0	1699126381	10.691135

In the past, you had switches that themselves indicated what state they are in, so if you cluster them on a board it's incredibly easy to find the one switched on at the moment [1].Then, some moron came up with switches that don't show anything anymore [2].Nowadays you're lucky if you get switches on anything at all. This [3] is how a standard stove looks like in new Swiss apartments nowadays. Good luck explaining this to your grandma. You idiots, it has one job, getting more or less hot!Recently I took a residential elevator that just had an empty touch field when you came in. No indication of what you could do whatsoever.	m_mueller	9.359621	6.1388025	comment	19.0	158.0	1471834950	-9.161888

Like half the damn video is black (pretty sure it is because they literally chop out half the AC sine wave with a diode).   LED Christmas lights are also really bad.Then compare it to something like a Phillips hue bulb.  The difference between the two is pretty big.On a side note I sometimes wonder if other animals have a quicker “refresh rate” on their eyes and see nothing but very visible flicker on these bad LED bulbs.  I also wonder if some animals could see the raster scan in action on old CRTs...	spookthesunset	9.625129	6.27091	comment	19.0	110.0	1582127472	7.952448

Uber has to also pay for engineers, sales/marketing to get customers/restaurants onto the platform, online infrastructure, customer service for both sides of the market, etc.Delivery is expensive. It's time-consuming, and customers are rarely willing to pay the true cost of it.Most of the restaurant delivery services were bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars last year. They've had a resurgence because of the Covid-19 but that's a blip compared to a normal situation.If people think it doesn't cost that much money to operate, then all restaurants shouldn't have a problem having their own delivery service.	colmvp	8.779016	6.5836496	comment	21.0	164.0	1588779014	4.0722938

Instead I crank it to watever wattage I need (usually the top one), and the time I think it'll take until the food I becomes hot. Aaaand that's it. No programming. No fiddling or mindlessly pushing buttons in the hopes of finding the right one. Only two dials. One for wattage (power output), and the other for time. I think it's really great. There's even some indicators on the Watt-dial for thawing and stuff like that, but I seldom need it, so I usually just keep it rested on 800W.
