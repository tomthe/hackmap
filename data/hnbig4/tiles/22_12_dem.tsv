This is a group that advocates an ideology that, when it was put in place, resulted in catastrophe for mankind.In other words, what they advocate is what exists at the bottom of the slope. You know, Godwin's Law and all that?		dandersh

28063640	13.754548	3.2959933	comment	3.0	18.5	1628097447	-14.44435	Pointing out a slippery slope doesn’t mean it isn’t worth considering the consequences.My position is indeed speculative, however it’s not without evidence. We very rarely regain rights or freedoms when they are taken so I think it’s valid to be concerned about the same thing happening here.		tracedddd
