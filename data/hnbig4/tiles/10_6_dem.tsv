The problem is that it does not, it has no timezone at all, and therefor is generally less compatible than creating a timestamp with timezone from a utc timezone object.I work on the Python API of a timeseries database and it’s very frustrating to have to accept timestamp objects without time zone because you don’t know what to do with them. People aren’t aware of this constraint, which leads to unexpected behavior.	stingraycharles	5.962288	-0.6817617	comment	3.0	33.0	1665304126	-9.637393

If T1 = T2 throw it out.As this is measuring the time between events rather than the rate of events, a decaying source just gives less bits over time rather than less randomness.> The trick I use was dreamed up in a conversation in 1985 with John Nagle, who is doing some fascinating things these days with artificial animals. Since the time of any given decay is random, then the interval between two consecutive decays is also random.

Storing a UTC timestamp generally works when recording an event that already happened.But it doesn't work for scheduling events like meetings, since there the authoritative time is often local time.

It sends random ""information"" (not information at all), because you can't control how the quantum waveform collapses. So you have to collapse the waveform, create a key that encodes your collapsed form to the information you want to transmit, and then transmit that key slower than light i.e. with radio.I guess you could argue that since the keys themselves are also indistinguishable from noise, we wouldn't detect slower-than-light key transmission either, though."	ethanbond	6.346283	-0.44610736	comment	3.0	11.0	1474480792	-8.511545

One needs to specifically know their data.Postgresql stores the timezone numerically, and not together with the location the timezone applies to. This means it is impossible to deduce DST from a timestamptz alone, but this is neccessary because two different locations in the same timezone might very possibly switch to and from DST at different times of the year.To store an unambiguous moment in time ( e.g. when scheduling an international conference call) one can store it as a timestamptz but this doesn't gain a lot over just treating all time in the database as UTC and then converting fro	yosamino	5.9424014	-0.6901219	comment	3.0	12.0	1625676133	-9.6727085

It does not matter mathematically why the host doesn't reveal the prize (i.e., whether P(host doesn't reveal the prize) < 1 or = 1), the conditional probability and thus the answer will be the same.Arguing Monty Fall is 50/50 is just the fallback position of unrepentant Monty Hall halfers, CMV.ETA: I also believe the 50/50 result hinges upon an implausible interpretation of the problem.

The difference is that UTC has leap seconds to deal with changes in the rate of rotation of the earth, while TAI marches on without any discontinuities.So for a date to be “in UTC” really just means it uses the leap seconds published by IERS.

It was arguably the biggest ""End Times"" event of the modern era, definitely IMO surpassing ""2012"" and other ""apocalypse panics"".The Y2k preppers and panic, I think, was the foundation for the modern prepper movement and the public's desire to flip from conspiracy to conspiracy to predict collapse."	criley2	6.0320663	-0.98850673	comment	3.0	13.0	1584030460	-4.967331

The choice to store two lengths in the packet header means that you can record both the actual wire length--the number of bytes that came in--and a bigger number that says where the next record starts, and any metadata you like in the gap.(This wasn't the original purpose of the second number: the original thought was that you would not be able to afford to store all the bytes of every packet, so the second number would say where you cut it off.)The 32-bit seconds / 32-bit microseconds timestamp in the packet header has evolved to use 32-bit nanoseconds as we got better at timekeeping, with just a change of magic number. Meanwhile, the 32-bit unsigned seconds count (since 1970, UTC) takes us all the way to C.E.2106 while the time_t crybabies are running in c	ncmncm	6.0658092	-0.7106889	comment	3.0	15.0	1584260884	5.3339033

These inputs must all be valid at some start time – this time forms the first clock “tick” in their design. Likewise, the outputs are then required from those inputs some time later. The time when all the outputs are valid given for a given set of inputs forms the next “clock” in a “clockless” design. Perhaps the first clock “tick” is when the set the last switch on their board is adjusted and the last clock “tick” is when their eye reads the result. It doesn’t matter: there is a clock.Put another way, combinatorial systems (the AND/OR/etc[1] logic gates that form the hardware logic of the chip) have a physical propagation delay.

Quantum annealing exploits quantum phenomena to do this better and probably more efficiently [2].On the other hand, we have ""general"" qubits: these can implement and carry out any arbitrary quantum computing algorithm (for example, Grover's search algorithm or Shor's factorization algorithm).

38147362	Where I live, we are extremely privi	"Where I live, we are extremely privileged in this respect - being at the western edge of a timezone that stretches further than its ""natural"" length, we even get sunsets past 22 in June. And you know what, it rocks. I see no significant drawbacks. During much of the year it's dark when we go to work, so what? For most people work is in offices with artificial lighting, leisure time is when you need the sun. Some people also talk about problems for kids but mine (4 year old) has no discernable problems to get up (given regular routine enforcement) and he loves being in the playground until dinner time, for which evening sun helps.The funny thing is that some people strongly advocate changing timezone to advance the clock 1 hour, saying that we are in the ""wrong"" one, it's not ""natural"", etc"	Al-Khwarizmi	5.8783307	-0.50950706	comment	3.0	10.0	1699150393	-9.645744

Winter is made even worse by having the sun go down before you get home from work.On further reflection, it does make a lot of sense for the 'getting up/out zone' to be as stable as we can make it daylight-wise, with any benefits of extra sun-time to be added to the end of the day. So keep DST, and 'normal time' - thus and the switch.Meanwhile I'll hibernate until winter/'normal time' is over and I can go do stuff again without the sun giving up on me.	somewhereoutth	5.874042	-0.5298787	comment	3.0	12.0	1699151056	-9.620693

Like, the idea of simultaneity is different than how we experience it, because two observers can literally witness a different sequence of events and there are no contradictions. (I hope I got that right)In a traditional shutter, each row of pixels are read one at a time, so there is an inherit arrow of time.

Take a localized date and time from the user, convert to utc, store that in one db field and the offset in another. It gets even easier if the TZ is a form option for an entity above the data being stored. To read you grab the utc date time, add the offset, grab the current time, convert to utc, add the offset, then do the comparison. That’s not much work for 100ks, a bit of work for millions, and a lot of work for billions. So real time must stay in the 100ks area, otherwise, do it in a background process and accept the cost. If you really need it, convert dates to big integers and do simple math. But check whether it makes a half order of magnitude difference in proc time. If not, move on.	notjoemama	5.954591	-0.6602237	comment	3.0	31.0	1700074996	-9.612608

Astronomy would be using specific time systems and/or adjustments anyway.	PeterisP	5.964342	-0.61845064	comment	3.0	18.0	1669194331	-9.606624

Find a job where you get to start a fixed time after sunrise.Having both would lead to longer working days in summer and shorter ones in winter, but I think that would be acceptable in many cases.The obvious reason why such a scheme wasn't implemented is that the calculations required would be annoying to do manually, but by now that can be taken care of by technology.	yorwba	5.9048004	-0.5468744	comment	3.0	15.0	1535729570	-9.573191

Dates are hard not because time is fundamentally hard, but because there is lots of complexity in human representation of time (different places at different times have had similar but different representations of time). But that's not inherent to time. Ignoring relativity, if everyone throughout time used something like seconds since Unix epoch (or some similarly arbitrary point in time), then writing programs about time would be much simpler.I think the numerals and numbers issue is more complex because numerals are fundamentally hard to reason about.

Would it really make any difference that the clock reads ""1am"" versus ""10am""? The sun and the earth do not care about our clock - the amount and availability of sunlight is not affected by what numbers we choose to use.

If you never believed ECT (for example, all physicists seem to think ECT is obviously false) it may not matter to you, but it still is a serious claim.Yes, Google probably can achieve quantum supremacy by slapping a few more qubits. But a few more qubits were, in fact, not slapped yet. So quantum supremacy is very much not achieved, and Google should not claim so.	sanxiyn	6.3493543	-0.9163932	comment	3.0	10.0	1571847158	-8.602804

I built and operated a superconducting two-qubit processor for my PhD thesis in 2010, so I have a good understanding of the challenges invovled in operating and tuning qubits. For me, seeing the 53 qubit chip, its wiring setup and the control electronics is just breathtaking.I think John's team neatly demonstrated that they are far ahead of the competition (e.g. Rigetti, IBM) in terms of maturity and qubit control, and if that's any indication of future success I would strongly bet on their team for building the first actually working quantum computer.

We now have the means to change that and e.g. set school timetables relative to sunrise and can expect everyone to have the means to follow them (e.g. a school app that shows you the exact times for every day, or a general converter from ""Sunrise +6 hours"" to clock time). Workplaces, buses could also adapt similarly.

When a leap second occurs, NTP servers will smear that second over 12 hours or so. Different NPT servers have different smear standards. During that smear, seconds are a bit longer, or shorter for negative leap seconds, than usual. But for general computing this doesn't matter.

Remarkably, quantum key distribution protocols like the one proposed by Bennett and Brassard provide information-theoretic security against such attacks, a much stronger form of security unreachable by classical means.This is not wrong, but in my opinion quite misleading.

The fall change in particularly raised hell in the hospital where I worked, since it literally created an hour that occurred twice.   Computers can store time in universal time, but a nurse medicates or does a procedure on a patient by clock time, and that duplicate hour and compressed shift increased risk of patient harm, misrecording of data, and overall stress a lot.And really, it's just dumb.	walnutclosefarm	5.9086113	-0.5681032	comment	3.0	33.0	1647383268	-9.616953

What I do care about is the fact that DST introduces needless complexity into the task of keeping time.I know it's stupid, but I just think DST is really unnecessary because of the fact that we have to adjust the clock on our microwaves, ovens, and cars. Not to mention, because not everyone observes DST, it leads to a lot of additional complexity when scheduling international meetings.Overall, regardless of your preferences, the world would be better if we didn't have to adjust the clock for no reason.	gh0std3v	5.8801694	-0.55331737	comment	3.0	10.0	1647384708	-9.61703

And they serve to address these things in a universal, coordinated way rather than asking each of us to change our schedules individually.During DST, we all agree to start our days, open our business, and adjust our schedules one hour earlier, but without changing our individual clock times.With DST all year long, can we choose to send our children to school at 9:30 instead of 8:30 during the winter? Should the school have a different winter schedule than a summer one? Or should we just wake up our young children well before dawn and drag them off?	mdavis6890	5.8733006	-0.529849	comment	3.0	19.0	1647385658	-9.619382

It protects against passive snooping but not against an active man-in-the-middle attack: thus it gives you no more protection than, say, the Diffie-Hellman exchange performed at the start of every TLS connection.  The main counterargument is that quantum computers can break Diffie-Hellman, and can do so retroactively if someone is tapping your communications today and saving them for the future.  But post-quantum public key cryptography exists; admittedly it’s not as vetted yet as the traditional kind. but it will be soon enough, so even if there’s some rationale for using QKD today, it’s not the “future-looking” technology it’s sold as.And in the meantime, if you really want to guarantee the confidentiality of your shared se	comex	6.33801	-0.9371785	comment	3.0	12.0	1547504894	9.155146

If you want quantum computing speedups, I think you're going to need qubits of much higher quality, and ultimately error correction or at least error mitigation.  In principle, D-Wave could do that, and I applaud any steps they take in that direction.

In Europe, almost(?) all countries use it, so if just Germany (where I live) abolished DST, we would be out of sync with the rest of Europe for half of the year.

I think most people would claim it also has timestamp 1435708799. but then ""Each Unix timestamp corresponds to one unique point in time"" isn't true, because 1435708799 now corresponds to two different points in time (30th June 2015 23:59:59 and 30th June 2015 23:59:60). Saying there is a unique mapping from unix timestamp to time would only be true if you either say that 30th June 2015 23:59:60 has no unix timestamp (which isn't a valid return value of any time API I've seen) or if you smear time."	wongarsu	6.039047	-0.6976917	comment	3.0	10.0	1688316582	5.071232

One-time adjustment to all timezones to get the system started.Result: Z timezone is equivalent to TAI.

(This is in contrast to fermions — if you swap two fermions, the state of the universe has its phase shifted 180 degrees.) If photons we’re distinguishable, then swapping two photons would swap them, and the resulting state would be different.  The matters from a statistical perspective.

So switching is a 66.7% probability of a win and is the 'inverse' of if you picked the car right on the first guess or not.The choice of which door Monty Hall shows you is constrained and isn't an independently random event since he never shows you the car when he opens a door.You can also laboriously go through every event and ""bifurcate the world"" and then add up the prob"	lamontcg	5.7706733	-1.2551353	comment	3.0	14.0	1708972067	-15.40999

Surely the only interesting thing to ask is, conditioned on seeing a goat, what's the probability the third door contains a car. The cases of observing a car are irrelevant since that's not the scenario. I'm still not convinced it's any different whether Monty Hall knows or not so long as the goat door is opened.Edit: having written this, thinking about the 100 door case. If 98 random doors open (that aren't the one I picked) then the fact they all contain goats is pretty suggestive that I have the car, or at least 50/50.

You get to pick one of the closed doors, and will win whatever is behind it (you want the car).One of the doors you did not pick is now opened, revealing a goat. You therefore now know the car is either behind the door you picked or behind the other closed door.In this setup, the question is: if offered the chance to switch your selection from the door you initially picked to the other closed door, should you switch?

Julius Caesar was famously told in Shakespeare’s play to: “Beware the ides of March,” also known as March 15, the day of his murder.> If the Romans started counting on the first day of March, which they called the kalends and moved backwards, then their days would progress retrospectively like this: the kalends is March 1, second kalends is February 28, third kalends is February 2"	Amezarak	6.190427	-0.6282738	comment	3.0	15.0	1709128068	4.2626753

In English, in a bit of Roman syncretism, the Roman Gods associated with some of the planets were largely replaced with their Germanic equivalents (except, mysteriously Saturday—from Saturn), but the Spanish names (modulo the weekend) retain their Roman origins: Martes (Tuesday) = Mars, Miercoles (Wednesday) = Mercury, Jueves (Thursday) = Jupiter (the cognate is more obvious when you consider the inflected forms of Jupiter have the root iov- which is evident in the phrase, “by Jove”), Viernes (Friday) = Venus.So Tuesdays in March are a bit of double-dipping for the god of wa	dhosek	6.298463	-0.5501096	comment	3.0	11.0	1709309115	3.2916455

This causes a rollover [1] every 19.6 years, and devices that aren't designed to anticipate it will report the current date/time as being two decades (or multiples of that) in the past.I guess the ultimate cause is data framing in the transmission protocol. The timestamp contains the number of weeks since 00:00:00 1980-01-06, together with the number of seconds since the start of the current week. The number of seconds in a week won't fit into 16 bits, so my supposition is that the designers had to also use some of the bits that could otherwise have been used for a wider week counter.I'd like to think that nowadays we'd use self-describing, upgradeable protocols.

Hash-based cryptography is not capable of providing public-key encryption, so unfortunately these are only useful for quantum-resistant digital signature schemes. But they're still very good at that.2. Since collision resistance is a stronger notion of security than preimage resistance and second preimage resistance, achieving collision resistance achieves all three. I just wanted to make this point explicit. Likewise, indistinguishability is an even stronger notion and subsumes all three.3. The current state of the art in quantum-resistant hash-based signatures is the SPHINCS family and its variants, includi	dsacco	6.336548	-0.9557675	comment	3.0	16.0	1523123857	-4.970742

If you don't know what epoch you're in, you don't know what the date is.Some GPSs solve this by recording the week number of their firmware build, and if the signals they get indicate the week number is less than that, they assume they're in the next epoch and update accordingly. Still means you run out of time, but you get a full ~19 years of life first (and then fail at some random GPS week). Some use fuses to record when an epoch has passed.

Check my bio before downvoting.You want a column that can store both timestamp and timezone, so why not just have 2 columns? You already have to convert the timestamp into the user's timezone when rendering because the user's timezone can change. Storing timestamps with timezone just complicates things, for ex:display_in_user_zone(TIMESTAMP UTC)display_in_user_zone(TIMESTAMP_WITH_TIMEZONE)The above is exactly the same, but the UTC one will prevent bugs in the long run.The only time it's acceptable to store time with timezone is with DATES that do not have a TIME component.If you really need to display the timestamp in the timezone the user originally entered, store the original timezone along with every timestamp.	welder	5.9496922	-0.6732144	comment	3.0	11.0	1554009676	-9.65358

The barrier is a locally uniform repulsive electrostatic field, while the the timer is a radially varying axial electrostatic field.

It shouldn't be confused with the DST issue.And if we can get DST all year round (which I'm personally all-for), it could help be the impetus to finally shift high school times.The fact of the matter is, our sleep schedules are determined largely by our school/work schedules. Simply from the popularity of DST in the summer, it seems clear that people do prefer for society to coordinate to wake up an hour earlier in order to have an extra hour of daylight at the end of the day.Here in the northeast, it's horrible in the winter when it's dark by 4:30 pm.

So my servers are now stratum 1, connected to GPS and atomic clocks, doing skew via chrony. I’m not paying a dime. I merely had to agree to keep my access low and my servers peer with each other to keep their clocks within a few nanoseconds of each other.It’s amazing what you can get, if you just ask. It’s the latter part you really want, which is doable with modern hardware accelerated time stamping and a peering NTP system (like chrony).	withinboredom	6.0126495	-0.68731314	comment	3.0	27.0	1681187983	5.5800543

Consequently, calendars would be engraved in stone on public monuments and the wealthy would have a calendar painted onto a wall in their home.The year would be written out as a set of 13 columns, with each column being a month.  They would then have the list of days in the month going down, and would note any holidays for the day.The only wrinkle in the Roman calendar were the ""nundinae,"" which were (very loosely) a sort of Roman weekend.

It's normal therefore to see dates in a format that's appropriate in context - a us news article might use a US format; others will use a different format that makes sense in context.Yet that's not how browser controls work - browser controls for all major browsers always use the client's date formatting settings when displaying dates (once popped up it's usually obvious which is which).  And that just makes them pretty much unusable; it means outside of the US you will have dates in text using 1 format, whereas browser controls use a different one.

Other people join groups too, possibly with different synchronizations.

Countries change their DST and timezone policies from time to time, and you don't want to have to deal with keeping track of that stuff or force upgrading your server for a petty politician/timezone issue.

There is literally no mainstream crypto algorithm beyond the 2000s that has seen any significant breakage. And very likely there never will be, with one exception: quantum computers will break modern ECC.I think there's simply a dark age of crypto research with 90s algos and earlier.

They correctly optimize for making most common cases trivial, while rare cases relatively easy.I think it needs to be said here: cross-timezone scheduling and datetime math are extremely rare relative to people's daily experience. It may not be obvious to us here, because we're much more likely to be dealing with the unusual case - building distributed systems, having international users/customers, working for multinational companies or cooperating with companies from other countries, etc. Almost nobody ever does that, and it makes no sense to make everyone do extra mental arithmetic when thinking or talking about other places, just for the sake of a minority 	TeMPOraL	5.9337635	-0.62740135	comment	3.0	25.0	1677747730	-9.639814

It's about the lowest possible energy expenditure to erase one bit of information (or irreversibly destroy it by performing a logical operation).  The principle comes about from reasoning about entropy loss in said situations.  There's a hypothesized fundamental connection between information and entropy manifest in physical law.  The idea is that if you destroy one possible state of a system, you have reduced the entropy of that system, so the 2nd law of thermodynamics implies that you must increase the entropy of the universe somewhere else by at least that amount.

Devices that use a battery (such as laptops, mobile phones, and CMOS clocks in PCs) must necessarily use some other means.It doesn't seem to be much correlated with price either: my alarm clock cost over $100 and it was still affected.

periodic in nature is used to track time: the Sun (years, seasons, days, day/dusk) and Moon (months, weeks, King tides). Consider even the starfield (astrology: years, decades+).Four seasons makes sense in all of these contexts, and I hypothesize that there are a lot of patterns in nature that are well bucketed into 4 sequential, equal seasons. This is impossible for me to demonstrate, unfortunately. Also, division by by 4 and 12, a year into four seasons is like a month into four weeks.

Friday in Dutch is vrijdag, which means 'free day' (and is pronouced 'freydag')Obviously the French is lundi, but I never made the connection with lunar.So for 28 years (4 year's worth of Moondays) of my life I never considered the connection between Sunday, Monday and Moonday.Perhaps it's not scientific fact but actually learning another language fluently and seeing the differences was pretty freaking awesome to me.There's other fascinating differences like the difference between 'Icing sugar' in English and 'Flour suger' in Dutch, one explains what you do with it vs the other explains what it resembles.Perhaps it only challenges simple brains like mine.	icc97	6.3384295	-0.5600499	comment	3.0	10.0	1493115395	3.392523

Classical asymmetric cryptography would be in danger, but there are alternative systems for which no quantum based attacks are known. They can be a bit unwieldy to use and have much larger key sizes than what we currently use - but methods that are hopefully quantum-proof may exist.

It’s basically doing a geometric construction of the sun’s path across the sky, using the distance between the hour hand and the 12 on the watch face as one of the input angles in the calculation. That’s quick (important because you have to repeat it while you’re marching) and easy to remember (also important because you might need it in a situation without access to Wikipedia). Under the assumption that the sun rises at 06:00 in the exact East and sets at 18:00 in the exact West, the construction is almost perfect. Of course, that’s never exactly true in real life, but still a lot more accurate than “well I know the sun is roughly South”.	codeflo	6.0107746	-0.33779186	comment	4.0	23.0	1666213022	5.109598

I've never seen a country outside of North-America that puts the month first, though my experience is limited to a few dozens of countries across the world.Unfortunately, other programming languages also think the USA format is the standard. Formatting dates with Golang relies on using the USA ordering. The more I use it, the more I despise it.

They will not understand and they will not care. They will most likely consider you crazy.

Break GPS, and you break timekeeping for a wide swath of the worldwide NTP pool. But thems the breaks when you can get access to atomic clocks in space (each GPS satellite carries an atomic clock on board) just by sticking an antenna out the window.If you require precision time for critical business operations (financial transactions, global database operations), you should be running a precision time source locally at your datacenter; for under $20 an attacker could deny you GPS timing.	toomuchtodo	6.0074425	-0.6796515	comment	4.0	14.0	1480384204	-8.148903

If the earth’s rotation speed changes their orbital speed doesn’t (not immediately, anyway).GPS absolutely needs to adjust for the variable rotational speed of the earth - otherwise the GPS coordinate grid would gradually move relative to the surface of the earth.So GPS doesn’t exactly need leap seconds but it really does care about how long a rotation of the earth takes which… amounts to the same thing.	jameshart	6.033637	-0.6654946	comment	4.0	16.0	1628018374	5.420415

They would like to travel to work after sunrise. They would also like to maximize the amount of daylight they get to enjoy outside of work.This means that in the summer, all the daylight before waking up is ""wasted"" so you want to move solar noon forward. But if you move it too far, it'll be pitch black when people get to work in the winter, which is why you then have daylight savings to move solar noon back a bit.If you live further south, like Hawaii, the difference in length of day between winter and summer is very small, so you can't shift solar noon around.

19922882	Here's a falsehood I've seen a bunch	"Here's a falsehood I've seen a bunch of times: the idea that Unix timestamps need to be converted to your local timezone. Unix timestamps are the number of seconds since a specific date in a specific timezone (UTC)! If a user gives you a Unix timestamp and you know they're in the PDT timezone, you should not add or subtract 7 hours of seconds to ""convert"" the timestamp to UTC! It already is. Similarly, if your client receives a Unix timestamp from your server, you shouldn't modify the Unix timestamp to ""convert"" it to your user's local timezone. Unix timestamps are always UTC. Your platform's date handling APIs should already offer a way to display a Unix timestamp in the user's timezone or an arbitrary one, and maybe even have a class that represents a Unix timestamp paired up with a spec"	AgentME	5.9674673	-0.67763245	comment	4.0	26.0	1557948663	-9.67065

It seems fitting that the 'work hours' should be 4 hrs either side of that (8am-4pm).Being a 'sunlover' I'm regularly up before dawn so that I can catch the first rays of Sun as it crosses the horizon. To me it's the most beautiful part of the day. Unfortunately, we have semi-arbitrarily defined 'zones' that fluctuate 1hr because of the propagandist notion that extra daylight at the end of the day means more people will be outside enjoying the Sun. This DST causes my work day to suddenly shift so that I'm forced to go to work earlier than normal, & I miss a lot of sunrises as a result.I like this idea of solar noon for times...

Event start/stop times were stored in UTC, but the event was displayed in the users timezone, and could cross daylight savings time boundaries. This was done with a mix of javascript on the front end and ruby on the backend.When first implemented, the equipment was reserved for the entire time of the event.

Jupiter spends an Earth year in each Zodiac, and the year in which it is in Aquarius is the year of the Kumbh in Haridwar- Apart from Haridwar, the Kumbh is also celebrated in Prayag (which is the festival this article is talking about), Ujjain, and Nasik. The years of these Kumbhs are offset from the one at Haridwar. In particular, the Kumbh at Prayag occurs when Jupiter is in Taurus (rather than Aquarius). So it should actually be called Vrishabha Mela...- The Kumbh that's happening in 2019 at Prayag is actually called an Ardh Kumbha Mela, or Half-Kumbh.

Everything else is applying legal and social context to the actual data.Here both of those pieces of information are missing on all three questions, so no answers can be given. Any answer to these questions makes assumptions or deductions about those pieces of information.	gregwtmtno	6.0419703	-0.6827249	comment	4.0	12.0	1644707056	4.7148314

It’s like asking if 2022-01-01 is an orange.Generally speaking you want context of what the date or datetime is being used for. If you want to know when Christmas takes place you will use a date: it does not take place on 2022-12-25 00:00:00 through 2022-12-25 11:59:59 because this would require a timezone and Christmas takes place at different UTC times around the globe. But you can reasonably say that Christmas takes place on 2022-12-25 and leave it at that to let the implementation of whatever program figure out if it is or is not currently Christmas based on the information it has about time and timezone.

I had an intern who wrote code that blew up if the timestamp of our DB server was ever >= 1 second after the timestamp of our app server.It couldn't fail at his desk, because he ran both servers locally while developing.  And it wouldn't fail in production in the morning, since we had a cron job that synced the clocks at midnight.  It took until after 5pm for the clocks to drift enough, meaning I was on call and the intern was not.But the bug didn't crop up until his code had been in production for a couple of weeks, so it was a real pain in the neck to track down.	knodi123	6.0095425	-0.6752009	comment	4.0	62.0	1645023732	-5.3290577

It was a very stressful time getting customers with many different versions of Java across dozens of platforms properly updated. A lot of customers were running ancient versions of Java that were well past EOL, but we still helped them out.Needless to say, I'm very happy this might finally happen.

16456858	Do we really need a quantum internet	Do we really need a quantum internet though? Our current non-quantum encryption system honestly works very well. Symmetric encryption is statistically unbreakable at large enough key sizes. Using a brute-force attack on a 256-bit AES key, it would take billions of years to crack, even with a quantum computer. Given a large enough key size (1024-bits), it would take longer than the heat death of the universe to crack such a key.For key exchange, quantum encryption is definitely better, but how much better is it than switching to a quantum resistant key exchange algorithm? And switching to quantum encryption would require a complete internet infrastructure overhaul, meaning fiber optics everywhere, all new routers (would packet routing still work?), new cell towers, and no more copper lines 	tristanj	6.3406906	-0.94795746	comment	4.0	16.0	1519527080	9.134963

How do you know this? Because you are aware there are difference in time of day between one place and the next. Armed with that knowledge you are required to do math about appropriate calling times regardless of whether there are time zones or not.But it’s even worse than that. Most of us don’t just take a crapshoot and guess whether it’s normal waking hours and shoot off a random phone call. Knowing when it’s a good time to call someone is more important and often you arrange calls before hand via text or email.

So the choice the host makes is less random than your (initial) choice and can give you new information.In particular, only two different things can happen:a) You initially picked the car. In that case, the host is free to pick any of the two remaining boxes since both have goats in it and neither were picked by you. In this case, it would be obviously unwise to switch.b) You initially picked a goat. In that case, the host has no choice at all: They must pick the one box with the second goat, which leaves the last remaining box as the one with the car.

But if the host knows what's behind the doors, and purposefully opens one of the remaining two with the goat, then you should switch doors to increase your odds to 66 percent.On the above article this is only briefly addressed and not explained.

Timezones are hard; dates are easy (or so we thought). When we billed a customer on their billing date we had to attempt to take payment at a time, which meant that our naive date handling converted that date into midnight UTC on that date, causing many western European customers to be billed at 23:00 or earlier on the previous day from their perspective.Furthermore, from the operations side we were often dealing things that happened ""on a date"".

In fact there is no such thing as fault-tolerant classical compute - the CPU only works if it “perfect” or “near perfect” (or if you had an ancillary computer that was perfect to implement the correction).

Likewise, a timeline split into contiguous periods can still represent out-of-order Dates.a Time Period object of ( Date, Duration ) would fix the first issue, and a TimeLine of ( Date, Duration, Duration, ... ) would fix the second one (assuming unsigned Durations!)	joosters	6.072793	-0.7009015	comment	4.0	21.0	1601889197	7.591931

The intent was for him to have prior knowledge or impeccable luck, and the wordsmithing of the question came later as, in my opinion, a failed rebuttal to the simplicity of the question.

They are not completely independent, because if they pick different doors, that forces the host to pick the last door.  Removing the host's freedom to choose a non-winning door (and effectively help the player) changes the math.  Having two players with the ability to choose different doors (but still 3 doors and the host must choose the third) makes it a different game with different dynamics.

In computing, timestamps are commonly expressed in formats like ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"" (year-month-day hour:minute:second).When pressed about this particular time detail, ChatGPT elaborates:
While ""YYYY-MM-DD"" is a common date format, it's not complete for a timestamp, which typically includes both date and time information. A complete timestamp might look like ""YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss"" to include hours, minutes, and seconds.So, no, this post doesn't contain a timestamp, and it already fails in its own advice."	mat0	6.018088	-0.71202606	comment	4.0	13.0	1700049887	-9.804181

15533570	I'm curious about Japanese support w	I'm curious about Japanese support which I think goes beyond locale.Japanese often uses 24 hour times like 18:00 vs 6:00pm and while I see you can specify valid times in that format I didn't see how to get it to display 18:00 instead of 6:00pm.In the forms on this pagehttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/in...When I typed 20:00 it assumed that first 2 meant 2am and then jumped to the minutes section as soon as I typed 2.  Note: My system settings are set to use 24 hour time.Worse, Japanese times are often in terms of the night before. So for example if you look at movie times a movie playing at 1:00am Saturday morning is listed as 25:00 Friday night.I wonder if input type=time is probably going to cause more trouble than it's worth	greggman	5.983502	-0.63093305	comment	4.0	15.0	1508770311	-9.638254

Since the two consuls ruled on alternating months, adding an extra month after February would give one consul one more ruling month, making it somewhat unfair.  Since leap years were handled irregularly back then, they were leap months, not leap days.The Julian calendar introduced the leap day instead, and maintained it in February as originally, and introduced it every 4 years (except years dividable by 100).This is also around the same time that July and August were named to their current names (named after Caesar and Augustus).

It wastes bits on an exponent and you cannot safely use == to compare timestamps that have math done on them or have been converted to/from a string (including e.g. sent as part of a JSON)."	dheera	6.159064	-0.7447281	comment	4.0	15.0	1686340824	5.20999

But no matter how long I stared at it, it wouldn't happen again. Only when I turned my attention to it would it sometimes seem to go backwards for the first second.With the ""your brain extrapolates the movement backwards"" this makes perfect sense if the second hand will vibrate a bit on each tick.

DST is a compromise to keep them from moving too much. But sunrise is a more important time than noon.So I've proposed something I call Sunrise Standard Time. It abolishes DST and splits the 24 primary longitudinal time zones into as many as 120 zones by cutting at the tropics and polar circles. Clocks adjust gradually each day to keep sunrise near 6am. The tropics would follow sunrise at the equator, and the temperate zones (between the tropics and polar circles) would follow sunrise at ~ 30deg N or S. That adjustment is about 1 minute per day.To refine things slightly, sunrise can be fixed at the latitude which divides the population in half in each zone (with the constraint th	beefman	5.9065905	-0.5203422	comment	4.0	16.0	1598671101	-9.565702

We are more synchronized in morning. In morning you have adults going to work and kids going to school. We are much less synchronized in the evening--young kids come home earliest, then middle and high school kids, then adults. Furthermore, more people stay late at work than go in early to work, so you get further spreading out of the commute home.With the morning getting heavier, more concentrated traffic, it makes sense to prioritize giving it the light.2.

To read the time, the Nanoprocessor had to convert the 7-segment display outputs back into digits. And to set the time, the Nanoprocessor had to simulate the right sequence of button presses to advance through the digits.'That's quite the convoluted bit of interfacing, but no doubt using the off-the-shelf digital watch chip made it a ""win"".

Day and night hours are drawn on the face.I used to have it attach to your google calendar and draw meetings onto the clock face too, but I think in the last 11 years the google calendar api has changed and I haven't updated it.Obviously once you have metric time, you need a metric week too, so I have new week days: nullday, unday, duoday, triday, quadday, hexday heptday	kybernetikos	6.1007833	-0.6270847	comment	5.0	35.0	1697110763	4.755187

But that's not the point, IMO.The point is, that there ALREADY EXIST both TAI and UTC. TAI is true monotonic (whatever it means in a relativistic universe) and doesn't make any compromises. UTC abolishes monotonicity in order to keep both the length of a second and the time relationship to the orbital rotation. They both work. For whatever reason (for obvious reasons that is, but doesn't matter) UTC was chosen in virtually any software system to keep time.So, ok, if there is a suspicion of leap seconds being unnecessary. How about moving from UTC time to TAI then?

Instead of applying DST in summer, they could instead change the work timings to 8 AM - 4 PM. Why is this not preferred? Isn't it simpler to keep the clock constant and the work timings variable than keeping the work timings constant and the clock variable? Personally, I think it is simpler for me to understand changes in work timings than changes in DST. Several times, I have had to perform mental gymnastics to figure out which way the clock moved and how it affects my schedule, i.e. whether I need to be sleeping an hour earlier than usual or an hour later than usual.	banksecopsguy	5.8892984	-0.56642956	comment	5.0	23.0	1467731002	-9.653702

Years aren't consistent both because the number of rotations don't evenly go into a single revolution, but also because Earth's rotation time is variable.  For instance, above normal fresh water accumulation on land will measurably change the length of a day.Generally, there are two solutions.  One is to track absolute time by increasing the clock as necessary to realign the day to the year.  There are Earth days with where the last minute of the day is 61 seconds long. Daylight Saving Time makes days with 23 hours or 25 hours.  And, of course, leap years add a day.

We know other public key encryption algorithms exist that can run on classical computers and still not be broken by quantum computers.

Getting clocks synced to within a few milliseconds is child's play, even for an amateur with $15 of hardware. Getting clocks synced within a few dozen microseconds is possible with GPS and some minor effort. Getting clocks synced within a few nanoseconds requires a lot more effort. I have never attempted anything below the ns range, but this process seems to produce clocks in sync within hundreds of attoseconds! This is within around 10^-16 seconds.

On a nice summer night, I want to have a BBQ with friends but usually it's not possible due to DST, it's simply too hot to be outside for any reasonable amount of time.  Summer nights get nice and comfortable AFTER the sun goes down, so instead of maximising sun-hours during non-working hours, we should try to minimise them.You want the hottest part of the day to be during work hours when you're in a nice airconditioned office building, and the coolest parts in the evening when you want to be outside.

ECC is great in that it is both fast, secure, its signatures, ciphertexts and keys are small. Every post-quantum algorithm fails in at least one of the categories, but as ECC excels everywhere, the overhead is basically bound by a factor of two.2.

That’s why seemingly storing utc is best, because you can apply whatever tz rule you want. But, because tz rules are decided by politicians (dst, ramadan, date line shifts, it gets pretty weird, …) and often with little advance notice, tz rule databases are often wrong in practice, which means storing only utc and getting zoned time back out of it reliably is hard.

Surely that is easier than permanent daylight savings time.I don't think it's possible to lobby employers to change their shift hours.

But since we know 1999-2001 has already past, we can hard code logic to add 20 years to any counter that's reporting that range. That updated logic rolls over on Sept 17th 2022, which buys us three extra years. This works for devices that will EOL within 20 years.I think devices that need a longer life should keep track of the last seen timestamp, then they can detect a rollover. The device would keep a local rollover counter and just add 20 years per count. This should stay correct until that counter rolls over, or if the device is offline for >20 years.	8organicbits	6.2224693	-0.6973791	comment	5.0	17.0	1662210365	5.0004783

But here you have a prediction that about 300 years are missing and this would directly explain the observed discrepancy in the drift of the calendar.As the author points out the problem is resolved because the Gregorian calendar reform only intended to reset the calendar back to the time of the Council of Nicaea, not the date when the Julian calendar was originally adopted.It's a neat example of how a theory's smoking"	antognini	6.170672	-0.59912306	comment	5.0	125.0	1657090234	4.175371

I would even argue that the existence of systemwide local time is a historical mistake.Why would you ever want to use the “local” timezone of the system on which you are running?  If the user is literally sitting in front of a monitor plugged in to the machine, it might be appropriate (but it should be a per-user setting).  But if the user is using X forwarding or ssh or a remote desktop, you have no idea what timezone the user is in.  (And this was common in the mainframe era!)

Luckily in several European countries there is some grass-roots activism now to move to standard time instead.

Converting Unix time to local time obviously has to take that into account, but we still need an absolute measure of our progress does the timeline which is what Unix time provides.This is why we use Unix time, it's the same everywhere and nothing short of relativity can affect it.	tus87	6.036175	-0.6834345	comment	6.0	28.0	1557947675	5.038849

I think the idea of permanently having the clock say an hour later than it is is just as senseless or more so than the yearly switch.

    t' = t.plus(periodLength days)

This way you can only `plus` in constant units (days), and `advanceMonths` is free to follow any heuristic and return anything depending on the value of `t` without breaking the expectations of `plus`, or you can have any number of functions with different definitions for ""ad"	hcarvalhoalves	6.1971292	-0.6600844	comment	6.0	21.0	1628120126	4.346294

Well I did anyway.There is not enough room here to explain fully but “Timestamp *with* time zone” effectively means UTC time which is the closest equivalent in PG to Unix epoch time and almost certainly what most people want. It doesn’t actually store a time zone.You’ll thank me later :)	doctor_eval	5.9482193	-0.6846968	comment	6.0	35.0	1628408264	-9.65543

28412135	Most clocks that we can think of inv	Most clocks that we can think of involve a clear entropic flow as part of the intrinsic mechanism:  an unwinding spring, falling sand, a descending weight, a discharging battery.But the very first clocks don't rely on this at least not as a principle mechanism.  Sundials, early astronomical observatories such as Stonehenge, or simply observing transits and occlusions, don't involve an entropic process.  Rather, they track the regular and sustained rotational or orbital movement of the Earth, Moon, and planets.  They track the passage of periods of time, but that tracking itself doesn't necessitate entropic flow.(The light that's necessary to observe the movements, of course, does.  But that would be part of any time-based observation, and isn't fundamental to the regular movement itself be	dredmorbius	6.0623903	-0.45366442	comment	6.0	41.0	1630730436	5.5254116

But, they didn't want to do that. They wanted to dump it all and replace it with an off-the-shelf solution running on Unix and/or Windows. And, for reasons which have absolutely nothing to do with Y2K itself (the expense and limitations of the mainframe platform), it probably was the right call. But, Y2K helped moved it from ""wouldn't-it-be-nice-if-we"" column into the ""must-be-done"" column."	skissane	6.036782	-0.9924851	comment	6.0	28.0	1584068771	-4.8523536

They're mandated by the standard, so there's always a timestamp, but it's often useless. For example, it seems some scanners don't get their time set, over the network or otherwise, _ever_, so you might have a bunch of scans performed a few years ago on scanner A with an accurate timestamp of say 2017, but in a new scan from last week that was taken by scanner B, which hasn't had its clock configured properly, it reports a date closer to the start of the unix epoch rather than 2020.Of course	ZeroCool2u	6.0493765	-0.6787207	comment	6.0	39.0	1589826766	5.376034

And there have been lots of cases where the programming world collectively agreed that some more complex idea was the right way, then a decade later everyone has reverted to the simple idea.UTC is simple and unambiguous. Time is a number representing a fixed point in time. When displaying it for humans, convert it into human form. When this principle is applied everywhere, it’s hard to make mistakes.My gut says that deprecating utc as the native time representation will be one of those ideas fervently embraced by a few, ignored by most, and then quietly forgotten about in a decade.	sillysaurusx	6.031245	-0.6652665	comment	6.0	39.0	1700409326	4.6999846

Any new timescale without leap-seconds needs a new name. Otherwise you get the same problem we made with GMT: ""Do you mean 14:03 UTC before 2035, or 14:03 UTC after 2035?""So lets call the new timescale NTS. Lots of records and timestamps have been made using UTC. So now we'll need a way of converting timestamps between UTC and NTS. We already have future timestamps in UTC; e.g. ""This record must be destroyed at midnight UTC, Jan 1 2036"". So even after we've switched to NTS, we'll still need to calculate UTC, so we'll still need leap-second announcements.Timescales are a deep mess, and as the author notes, having them managed by a bunch of treaty organizations is nuts; treaty"	denton-scratch	5.98957	-0.65863824	comment	6.0	27.0	1675082717	5.383143

The integer reflects the number of complete cycles. So lunch time in Greenwich 'pi'.It has the benefit that its ""source"" is actually the planet, so we can use a telescope at Greenwich to pick a certain alignment of stars as the ""zero"", ""zero"" point and then each time it realigns to that exact point, you can increment the ""year"" count.I believe we can build a robust system"	ChuckMcM	6.032671	-0.5692653	comment	7.0	27.0	1483254169	5.121794

There are no popular public-key encryption schemes that are safe against quantum computing.The only popular public-key encryption schemes are based on RSA and ECC, both of which are broken by variants of Shor's algorithm.Yes, popular symmetric cryptography is safe to the best of our knowledge, but that doesn't help much since virtually all symmetric crypto that is actually applicable at scale relies on some initial public-key crypto for bootstrapping.And yes, there's research into post-quantum public-key cryptography, but it's pretty underwhelming so far. It seems possible, but at a horrible loss of performance (keys are sized on the order of kilobytes or more, as opposed to 32 bytes for ECC).I'm pretty pessimistic about the con	atq2119	6.3385434	-0.95059854	comment	7.0	43.0	1540035654	9.142354

I guess having a human readable time would be fine but the science part is more interesting.With a clock of such precision, how could I synchronise it?

Always store user's timezone as part of their preferences. Helps in use cases like send the reminder to the user at 8:00AM in their timezone.4. All APIs always return time in UTC and user's or the places timezone in the output.5. It's the job of the frontend to convert the UTC time to proper timezone and display it to the user.Never had a use case I couldn't solve with these rules.	pritambarhate	5.9409223	-0.66584164	comment	7.0	33.0	1647174452	-9.589438

Voters will have a choice to stay with DST, going to standard time year around, or asking Congress for permission to stay on DST year around. My guess is none of the options will receive a majority vote but year around DST will get the plurality. Since that requires Congressional approval and the ballot referendum is non-binding, nothing will change as a result. Having discussed the issue over the years, it's also a bit sad realizing how people don't understand that this doesn't actually create an extra hour of sunlight, it just shifts an hour of pre-noon sunlight to be afternoon sunlight.

Sure there are times when minutes count, and there are occasions when I want to time something to the second, but from a UI perspective those are not common use cases that warrant screen real estate for extra digits especially back then.	phkahler	6.1295977	-0.62557876	comment	8.0	57.0	1490555342	5.231561

We can do time sync, since we figured out how to do that pretty well. And so we asked: is this part of a trend where we’re going to start programming these systems differently? And [researchers] got kind of excited about that possibility of us being able to pull this off.”Who gave this guy who's apparently never heard of kerberos, ceph, SAML, or any other technology the rights to interview? Sure, their windows are larger, but ""nobody uses time"" is so clueless it blows the mind, and it's hard to imagine who decided that ""NTP, but machine learning"" is a $21M idea"	evol262	6.063614	-0.6974514	comment	8.0	68.0	1647654390	-8.18805

The hyphens make the notation ambiguous with substraction, therefore in programming languages dates are quoted and represented as strings, which in turn get passed to a parsing function.    - to_date('2022-03-27')
    - datetime.strptime(""2022-03-27"", ""%Y-%m-%d"")

The obvious alternative is to use an unambigous notation from the list such as dot notation. 2022.03.27 doesn't collide with floating point number notation, nor with ipv4 notation, nor any arithmetic operation and thus can be used to represent dates in programming languages directly - without quotation and without the need to stringly type them.It's one of those many ex"	snidane	6.1375237	-0.7409162	comment	8.0	32.0	1651347324	4.4950776

It’s not, it’s to move an hour of sunlight from the start of the day (say, 4am) to the end of the day (say, 9pm) so that you use less energy in the summer (hence the ‘savings’), and then you can enjoy that rather than being asleep.Moving to summer time year-round means that the mornings in the winter will be darker. I like having a bit of daylight in the mornings in the winter, and I’ll miss it when it’s gone. As I’m sure a lot of people will when they realise that getting ‘rid’ of it makes the winter worse, not the summer better.	thomasedwards	5.8756714	-0.5183134	comment	8.0	47.0	1551877619	-9.608369

Its far, far better to simply use a YYYY-MM-DD string. I cannot stress how much better this is, but its not obvious why its better to someone who has had that axiom drilled into their heads, and has never ran into this situation before."	015a	6.0796437	-0.7235632	comment	8.0	47.0	1624901533	4.5805755

My 22:00 is your 22:00 and their 22:00. For me it's my bedtime, for you it's lunchtime, and for them it's breakfast. People should adjust their daily activities around the daylight hours they have, and let time be less of a controlling force in their lives.We live in a globalised world, especially in business. So with the whole world on UTC, everyone knows when the meeting starts, when the delivery arrives, and when the end of the year starts and finishes.And if that fails, we should just attach rockets at the poles and push/pull the planet back upright to get rid of the problem altogether.	mattowen_uk	5.9824224	-0.58232737	comment	8.0	31.0	1632413859	-9.5933695

I know this may sound impractical (it is) but it has always felt like an important issue to me as a mostly secular Jewish American. In my opinion the Gregorian calendar offers very little advantage (perhaps even disadvantage) over lunar-solar alternatives. Its popularity has been deeply tied to Christian imperialism and its adoption has often been forced. The Gregorian calendar is technically more accurate as it is off by 27 sec/year (1 day in 3236 years) compared to the Jewish calendar which is off by 7 min/year (1 day in 216 years). This, however, has always felt to me like comparing apples to oranges. The accuracy of the Gregorian calendar comes at the expense of functionality (lunar calculations) which I find to be incredi	connorgutman	6.1745167	-0.59620035	comment	8.0	60.0	1665184585	4.334974

Knowing that we're in week 42 of the year somehow helps me get a better sense time passing than knowing it is the third Wednesday in October.

Maybe because they're assuming NTP, so have cut costs by using less accurate crystals? I've had systems in storage for many years, and the RTC was within a few seconds of the current time when turned on again.	userbinator	6.053862	-0.6816459	comment	8.0	43.0	1506593999	5.5033855

It just changes how time is printed. That's it.So the second problem is that our text-based server world, for all its benefits, doesn't cope well with per-user parameters. I mean ... timezone support on Unix is basically buggy. It doesn't matter what TZ I set in my .profile, nevertheless the timezone of logs is in whatever TZ the server is running in.

Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it's safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-'em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (""it's still kind of daytime"") extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you're waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM.

Just for laughs, Java seems to have its own TZDB so in general your OS and application layer might disagree about zones.This is all okay for most users who just get an automated OS push, but some vendors operating national networks that need to do some things in localtime need to upgrade their platforms and do acceptance testing every time.And then there's bugs.Just for example about the variations, here's a recent TZDB change, seems Fiji is rejiggering their dates only a month away.

The New Year on 1st March also explains why the Leap Day falls after the 'last day of the year' on a day of its own: the 29th February.I'd like to see a new calendar that reverts to the Equinox as the New Year's day and has the 28th February (and the 29th February if needed) as special 'Non-Week-Days' as part of a New Year Holiday Period. That would allow the New Year to start on the same day of the week as the previous year. In other words, we would have a perpetual calendar that never changes from one year to the next.	simonblack	6.2056284	-0.6112046	comment	10.0	47.0	1709163211	4.227883

Regardless, for me the loss of daylight hours has always been difficult. Moving ~10 degrees closer to the equator has helped, but the general lack of any daylight in the evening is often still a problem.Since, as the author notes, it’s the same amount of daylight, I’d rather see it in the evening because people have little control over when their day starts.

It's true that internally a TIA timestamp is cleaner for storing a moment in time, but that is only half the issue.I like to think of it as a difference between physical time and human time.For engineering, science, precise measurement, simulation and such using TAI is clearly the cleaner, most robust solution. But as soon as you have a humans ""perception"" of time as part of the system a timezone aware timestamp is required. But even then, the most common version of that ISO 8601 is flawed.ISO 8601 only has a fixed offset, it has no concept of timezones or geolocation.

If you switch or keep, you're still choosing from two doors that contain a car and a goat. The other door is no longer relevant and doesn't affect the new state at all.It's your perspective (narrowing the choice down) that changes, not the position of the car. Like getting a run of red in roulette and thinking the next one has gotta be black.	lachstar-x	5.7633543	-1.2586586	comment	10.0	45.0	1620528724	-15.418465

38148654	I think the best backwards-compatibl	I think the best backwards-compatible calendar that we should adopt is the ISO week date calendar, commonly used in finance: forget months, every day is a week number + a day. So today is 44.7, which means week 44, day 7. This also gets you a nice almost even 13 weeks/quarter, and easy calculations (that report is due w48.5, aka Friday in 4 weeks). We used a worse version of this calendar in Intel and it was great (we callled them work weeks instead and iirc it was not iso8601 aligned).This way, people can play with legacy dates for their birthdays, religious observances, etc but use a sane system at all other times. This already happens with Chinese/Islamic calendars anyways, Chinese new year is a date I have to look up every year, and that’s OK because the calendar is used for literally 	e63f67dd-065b	6.17268	-0.62243044	comment	10.0	82.0	1699163430	4.251996

DST is an ugly hack that we use on top of our midnight-based time system to roughly approximate a constant sunrise time.Imagine if 00:00 was defined as the time that the sun rises. You could set your alarm to 00:00 and start work around 01:30 or 02:00 every day.There'd be no need to worry about kids going to school in the dark, and the shift between summer and winter time would be continuous instead of an abrupt shift (so no more DST-induced heart attacks or traffic accidents).

Some theoretically “simple” rules seem to routinely violate human intuition, and the almanac actually changes based on laws and stuff.Keeping everything in Zulu ms or ns and rendering into timezones as late as possible is a useful guideline as far as it carries one, but sometimes it’s not enough, this is one of a zillion reasons why e.g. calendaring is just really hard.I’ve long since mentally tagged “timezone handling”, in any language, as a slow zone: let’s stop and really think this through.	benreesman	5.938754	-0.6376822	comment	12.0	82.0	1683890529	-9.609546

I personally enjoy that the sun only sets around 21:30 in the summer, and I like the cozy early sunset in winter. I never had any problems with the one hour less sleep once a year, especially since it is easy to allow for a transition phase of around a week. I have 1 clock in the house which doesn't adjust automatically, so this can hardly be called a nuisance. More than once I didn't even notice the change until the evening - I just got up when my alarm went off.When the European Union conducted a poll 3 years ago, 4,6 million people answered. That is less than one percent (!) of the population, which is evidence that the overwhelming majority of people just don't care.	lqet	5.8799815	-0.50743544	comment	12.0	43.0	1635787397	-9.5904255

I gave up when I realized the choices were either lobby the federal government to change the regulation or change the entire culture of the western US to start and end its business day earlier.	bsimpson	5.8746166	-0.5720069	comment	13.0	203.0	1537215427	-9.647176

My walk had the answer:In Bern, you see clocks everywhere! Towers after towers, buildings after buildings have clocks of varying sizes and shapes and artwork. The city of Bern is crazy about having giant clocks all over. In 1905, all these clocks must be manually synchronized and people may have often noticed slight differences as they walked and you cannot not think about synchronization every day!Inventors in Bern were working on how to synchronize them automatically.

It's because we historically use noon as our reference. We think of noon on day N+1 as being exactly one day after noon on day N. Noon is a sensible reference, fairly easy to determine with ancient technology.Suppose that instead we had historically used sunrise as our reference.

All you have to do is allow people to store an offset for the time zone, and RTC issues are a thing of the past.	firewolf34	5.997179	-0.61490643	comment	15.0	124.0	1692214874	5.478004

From my perspective as a physics PhD graduate, I firmly believe that a quantum computer capable of breaking public key crypto will never be built. This is because as you add more qubits, there's increased interference between them due to the additional connections required.It's similar to how FM radio works: there's a main frequency and several sidebands. When you adjust the tuner to pick up a station, you're essentially ""interacting"" with the corresponding station. But if there are too many stations, you may no longer be able to hear the music, and as a result, there would be only a static noise present.This leads me to a somewhat cynical conspiracy"	JanisErdmanis	6.3427124	-0.9416507	comment	15.0	93.0	1695151049	9.149132

I've seen this before in a couple of git-related and other applications but personally never understood why one would pick this over date/hour. Is this a cultural thing? Do some people actually find this better (from the point of conveying timestamp information)? My main problem with it, apart from not having a high resolution, is that it usually just leads to me trying to calculate the actual date from it because that just works for me, being used to it. Same with e.g. Thunar: to me it's maddening that it defaults to displaying 'today/sunday/saturday' and then mixes that with plain dates for timestamps older than a week (or so). Can be me, but this is just so confusing and harder to parse?	stinos	6.1334267	-0.6996523	comment	15.0	82.0	1602487209	4.556473

The week is still popularly understood to start on Sunday in English Canada, and probably some other parts of the English-speaking world.A quick check of Wikipedia suggests Arabic, Portuguese and Vietnamese, all use number-based systems to name the days of the week, and they are indexed from Sunday = 1.  But yes, the other is more common.  Most of the Slavic languages, and Chinese, among others, use indexed from Monday = 1.Then there's Swahili: Saturday = 1 and Friday = 7.

But for events in the future that needs to happen on a specific ""wall clock point in time"", it might be better to actually store the yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss as a string with a timezone next to it, because timezones can and do change often unpredictably. If you pre-calculate what ""4.00pm next August 1st"" is as a UTC timestamp today, and the timezone rules are updated between now and then, your UTC timestamp may end up being incorrect. I guess you could have an additional ""precalculated-utc-timestamp"" column but regularly re-calculate this from the ""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss + timezoneID"" (especially when you upgrade your Olson tzdata)."	0x0	5.9429107	-0.6567349	comment	15.0	126.0	1527620656	-9.617067

If permanent DST really results in the entire country turning into sleep deprived zombies having spontaneous heart attacks as they arrive at work and crashing into children going to school, then there'll be pressure to change it -- but we will have at least already started the p	stormbrew	5.886414	-0.5638107	comment	17.0	365.0	1647376326	-9.622711

None. None whatsoever.For US staff with US regional settings, it's always obvious which date is correct. That is the one single case where there is no confusion. This works as expected for just 4% of the world population, but it is those 4% of the world that get to decide the date format.It's the most obnoxiously American attitude imaginable to ignore this issue because it doesn't affect them... only the other 96% of the planet./rant over	jiggawatts	6.171166	-0.7119739	comment	20.0	163.0	1614325602	4.413005

Or is time going to be based wherever we land or travel (e.g. divide up Mars into time zones upon colonization)?

The basic argument seems to be that it reduces 'translation costs'. But..does it? What about the benefits of being able to refer to times without having to localize them? If my friend on the other side of the country says ""I woke up at 9 this morning"", I have a pretty good idea of what that means. If we used this new system, i'd have to mentally translate.In terms of scheduling things, it would get easier in some ways and likely harder in others.

This article glosses over the real world problems that detaching from UTC will cause.This article details some of the problems: https://www.ucolick.org/~sla/leapsecs/dutc.html(You may want to scroll down to ""Implementing the plan outlined at Torino"".)If we end leap seconds, it doesn't take long - only until 2028 - until ""midnight"" is sufficiently far from ""the middle of the night"" that you will have to consider the legal issues caused by events that happen just before or after 0000 hours.By 2055, the ""minute"" displayed on a clock may be incorrect, which again may cause issues with legal timestamps.And by 2083, sundials are measurably wrong.All because programmers wanted to save some lines of code."

Then you understand 80 is high warm, closing in on hot, etc.Similarly for our date system, we lead with names and important information rather than numbers. We're not feeding a number into a machine, we're speaking to humans.Consider any other Label. You don't say ""25th Apartment"", you say ""Apartment 25"", ""Unit 25"", ""P.O. Box 25""Here we are on March 25. The year comes last because it's least important."	warent	6.147418	-0.71240973	comment	27.0	127.0	1679757497	4.529263

But it's possible that between now and 2030 they might adopt Central European (Summer) Time[1], or retry British Double Summer Time[2], or scrap daylight savings entirely. Therefore, what happens to 6pm with respect to any given epoch might vary wildly between now and 2030.But it would be nice to set a calendar event for ""6pm London time"", whatever London time happens to b"	Karellen	5.9408174	-0.62889504	comment	29.0	225.0	1693502945	-9.632135

I think many folks, especially in northern latitudes, will regret the early summer sunsets or sunrises if we were to stay on standard time year round.In Seattle, for example, I think the sun would rise before 5 am as late as early August.  On the other hand, if Seattle stayed on DST (+7) year-round then the sun would rise after 8AM from early November to late February, and as late as 9AM in December.Seattle is an extreme case, because it is so far north, but New York City is not that different, and I think more people would bemoan the lack of after-work daylight during spring and summer th"	jp57	5.8850465	-0.53303945	comment	30.0	177.0	1635787462	-9.556069
