It's not as though you need spectacular sums of money to run a search engine or a social media platform.

The AWS status page is a marketing gimmick whose job is to stay green, not a good faith attempt to assess and report status. If there's an outage, seeing it accurately reflected on the status page is the exception, not the rule.		jjoonathan
