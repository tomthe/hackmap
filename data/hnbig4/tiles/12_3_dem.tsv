These enterprise systems are are all on the back of employees, by which I mean they are forced to take the extra time to use them while they are extremely unfriendly to the user - because they are bought by execs, and their value is not at all apparent to those who use then.A simple example, imagine you told employees they now had to log their time and account for each 15 minutes, and do so through some kind of java.swing interface from the 90s that routinely screwed up, and they don't get any extra time to do so, and they're already busy.

So many of its users simply use it because it's included in their Office365 subscription, whereas with Slack, Zoom, etc they'd be paying $8+ a month per user.While the development effort, skill, and time, that goes into building something like Discord is certainly significant, I feel it's certainly something Microsoft could have built given their resources and technical aptitude. What you can't buy is the inspiration, ideas, and culture that make something like Discord happen.If it follows the inspiration and ethos of tools 	bacbilla	7.742281	-4.325426	comment	3.0	12.0	1616494010	-9.123942

This advice comes from the same place as ""if you want to make a game don't write your own engine"", which is probably works for most people.Vulkan is great as a beginner if you want deep understanding of the graphics pipeline and are ok with some pain and confusion and a lot of ""boilerplate"", which comes from Vulkan having few defaults.

That's the great thing about email, because the standards are open you'll be able to extract more value from that same data with each passing year using products that haven't even been created yet.Conceptually this is similar to having a wiki, except for that unless your company has people whose full time job it is to maintain the wiki then it will always be out of date and inaccurate; just deploying some wiki software tends to be pretty useless, and even in the rare cases w	Alex3917	7.6651645	-4.446005	comment	3.0	15.0	1583029546	9.107972

(eg moving away from handles to user ids likely enables active directory integration).Back to the question: Why raise money? Because enterprise whales are a much more solid backbone than thousands of 20 person startups, and they still have some eng investments they need to make to handle someone like Walmart in an on premise installation with 10s of thousands of users.	phamilton	7.650223	-4.4530272	comment	3.0	15.0	1505702002	9.208584

Don’t take the keyboard and and mouse.3) Listen to them explain their problem, if they feel heard you’ve finished half the work.4) Explain the solution and give them space to learn. Ideally, they never need help for this issue again, but if they do, just explain again.That said, sometimes people are stressed and in a hurry and they just want the printer to work, so it’s better to skip the above and just fix the problem.

A bot keeps a few channels in a ""free"" pool, marks some as ""occupied"", and moves the surplus to a ""dormant"" section for UX purposes. Newcomers often get confused and ask questions in already-occupied channels, etc.Bots make this possible but it's never as good as the threading that exists in Slack or Zulip.

It's a regular chat. But the threading model also encourages long-form, more forum or email like discussions.Threads are easily discoverable and it's trivial to catch up on all the relevant discussions that you missed, while skipping everything that doesn't concern you.You can still have some regular chat channels for typical ephemeral discussion that no-one is expected to read. It's really a great tool.The only downside is the very subpar UX when compared to Discord or even Slack.	the_duke	7.574952	-4.394514	comment	3.0	26.0	1620956209	-11.004833

I think it would be a pretty great way to do some phishing, just need to scrape the urls and brute force channel names with messages with links to websites you own.	bostonsre	7.641679	-4.472626	comment	3.0	17.0	1623439518	9.220527

33694231	To a certain extent, you are correct	To a certain extent, you are correct that the physical support like jams and toner replacement was typically handled by the lab. However it still meant having 30 printers, all of them of different makes and models and firmware versions on the network. Thirty ethernet runs having to be patched in, and 30 more ports on the switch lit up, and 30 more static IP leases doled out. All of that is relatively minor on its own, but at the end of the day its still a liability. Not all liabilities are necessarily a bad thing though, if it allows you to reach a desirable outcome. So what was the desirable outcome in this case?Not having to walk 30 feet down the hall to the shared copier/printer on every floor to retrieve your print.	tengbretson	8.327692	-4.102462	comment	3.0	11.0	1669047446	6.833285

If you are having motorcycle or other engine repair done, waiting for a gasket can take a week or sometimes more depending on supplier location, and it's something printed from gasket paper.A website where you can print aftermarket gaskets on demand, and even do it with CAD files or derive them from edge detection in photos would make its money by shipping faster than OEMs, and without worrying about inventory. Retooling an existing custom sticker printing business would do it. Unit margins are like 100x the cost of the paper, and shipping cost margin is the other one.	motohagiography	8.370761	-3.9912817	comment	3.0	13.0	1669296312	6.783237

I would be concerned that achievement hunters would in fact be motivated by your idea and will be printing benchies or other useless objects they don’t actually want to keep the streak up.

I'm not convinced that human-provided topic labels could ever be replaced by an AI deciding which things should be clustered, but maybe I'm wrong...	nikisweeting	7.5761437	-4.4022174	comment	3.0	11.0	1585863651	-11.0228615

So it's not as if there is no reason for Metal to exist (of course I would be happier if Apple contributed to Khronos to get those features in Vulkan instead).But the walled garden approach seems counterproductive here.

22899766	I think the answer to this is emergi	I think the answer to this is emerging, but I would say yes. Vulkan and SPIR-V are rapidly gaining features, while OpenCL is stagnating. Some of these features are very recent, like pointers and a memory model. Another area I'm expecting Vulkan to pull ahead is support for efficient float16 computation, which is important for ML workloads, and is increasingly well supported in hardware.One thing to keep in mind though, programming directly in Vulkan is too low-level for most users, while OpenCL is a fairly friendly API. We need tools that can compile to SPIR-V and deploy on Vulkan, but high enough level you can express your problem rather than (for example) manually placing pipeline barriers between dispatches.

This usually involves dealing with big lattices where parts of the lattices can be updated in parallel, but on the edges, there need to be some data sharing involved. Same question, but for multiplying big matrices, as many of those numerical methods allow to reduce the task to multiplying huge matrices.	dchyrdvh	8.720014	-4.44984	comment	3.0	12.0	1587658423	7.6413636

There's a good reason to own at least a B&W printer even if there's a Staples downstairs: your home printing needs will predominantly fall outside the business hours. After all, during business hours you are most likely at work.The need to print something is usually a result of some chain of actions. You noticed an interesting paper. You have a stack of documents to sign. Your kid just realized, at 22:00 sharp, that they need some printout for school tomorrow. These are things that, for most working adults, tend to happen during evenings and on weekends - because that's the only time they have to deal with personal stuff. Not having a printer available at a moment's notice tends to be a huge blocker.	TeMPOraL	8.337576	-4.0921497	comment	3.0	15.0	1627975331	6.772484

You don't need apps to print and printing costs nothing compared to traditional printing.

Still, I would appreciate not having to run out and buy a blue cartridge just to print 3 pages of a text document.	rafaelm	8.320738	-4.0872936	comment	3.0	11.0	1473680262	6.8711786
12479539	I worked for some months on the prin	I worked for some months on the printer industry (on the image processing side). Innovation is not a word we used a lot. A printer is basically a microcontroller driving a DSP doing some image processing (scaling and dithering mostly). The µC then sends that to another µC driving the different motors. The DSP is a generic component used by half the industry. The other half used another DSP. Both the µCs are generic components used by half the industry. The other half, you know the drill.It was maybe 7 years ago, and I guess now they have a single µC containing the DSP and able to speak USB, do the dithering, and control the motors all in one package.  There is almost no R&D in those markets. That's how you get a $20 printer (and $50 ink cartridges).Do no count on printing on PCBs or fabric	jylam	8.33157	-4.0294747	comment	3.0	10.0	1473687480	6.8301845

I was able to find a plastic gear that got stripped due to an object falling into the paper tray - cost me about $8 and 20 minutes of repair time and it's good as new.The average person doesn't print much, but when they do they really need it right now (e.g. boarding passes, legal document to sign, concert tickets, whatever) and having a rock-solid printer that you know just works every time even if you haven't printed in 6 months is great.	phil21	8.322305	-4.0990863	comment	3.0	12.0	1473694957	6.7922225

The printer is tiny, quiet, fast, etc. I can't believe people still buy anything else, after all we don't print photos at home much anymore, do we?There are other manufacturers that do the same kind of model.Just avoid HP and (in my experience) Canon.

A good Slack culture means as an engineer you can find tons of historical context on discussions / decisions without someone needing to forward you a bunch of emails or historical docs.  It also means you can get relatively quick answers to tribal knowledge questions while also have an async option for everyone on the answering side to shut down Slack for focus time.Of course if you're only optimizing for your single productivity measured in lines of code written then I can see your point, but software engineering at scale is a team sport, and Slack has traits that make it better than email/in-person discussion/phone/zoom/in-doc comment thread.	dasil003	7.6400795	-4.4602838	comment	3.0	11.0	1641935249	9.237084

It's easy to have everyone focused on the same topic in a given channel, without any confusion or missing information between different channels or private messages.Moreover, I have also considered Slack to be asynchronous - meetings are necessary for sync work, but I find Slack to be working perfectly if no one expects that you reply within minutes, but within a few days (if you are not actively working on a project - in that case a lot of times is just easier to schedule very fast meetings during no-focus times)	hackandtrip	7.6340566	-4.4428787	comment	3.0	19.0	1645142368	9.221887

The NFC comes pre-loaded with 0xFFFF-Count in a special register that increments when hit with a non-password protected NFC command emitted by the printer when any label is ejected. So even if you don’t print, you just eject, the labels are depleted. There seems to be a buffer at the end for this kind of “rewind” process or user error … but it’s limited.

I wrote a path tracer as an OpenGL shader that had a lot of branching and didn't use any special data structures for ray intersections and it was still much faster than running it on my CPU.So in my example, the GPU for each pixel has to find out of a ray collides with any object in the scene, and then scatter that light off of that object up to some maximum number of scattering or until it leaves the scene. This results in a variable number of branches per pixel (between about 1 and 16), but still gets good performance.	montecarl	8.707284	-4.0877495	comment	3.0	11.0	1543267882	7.5099554

I suspect we will see it go the way of using billboards to approximate auras around string light sources.  It added a lot of atmosphere in the late 90s/early 2000s, but the feasibility of real-time bloom (and more recently volumetric lighting techniques) have relegated it to the history books.	skohan	8.688731	-3.9651916	comment	3.0	18.0	1543585418	7.4128447

They're definitely gunning for them, and Microsoft has changed Skype so much that they've alienated much of their user base in addition to having lots of security flaws.

If it could be used both in a browser and standalone even better.  If it was available outside of a browser (even as a Vulkan/Metal wrapper), I think it could become a no-brainer replacement for where OpenGL ES is used today.I understand that engine developers can get some (small?) percent improvement from an ultra-low-level API that exposes more platform specific details.  But they almost always support multiple APIs natively, and already use the low level ones where available.  There may be a small performance benefit (over a higher level API) in the browser, but I don't think the browser is a likely target for ultra heavyweight 	matt_m	8.734834	-4.600205	comment	3.0	14.0	1518299463	-5.9032903

Well, yes. 25 years ago, I owned a dot matrix printer. It was loud, you could tell what the printout was supposed to say (but it was by no means pretty), it was slow and monochrome. For the same price today, I can get a really good color laser printer, or even a 3D printer.  Again, I know that many of you love your printers and can’t imagine not owning one.

That just happens to be using the iGPU on Intel so you don't need a discreet GPU necessarily, but this is also missing if you have a CPU-only sku like the -f suffix partsThe only difference is the vulkan spec is _in theory_ cross-platform. However, since MacOS doesn't support Vulkan and MoltenVK doesn't implement this extension (and probably won't), and this extension also isn't implemented on Android, then your scope of actual availability is quite pathetic. So it probably doesn't make sense to move off of VAAPI regardless unless you really want Linux & Windows to share a codepath, even though you have something OS-specific anyways for MacOS/iOS & Android.	kllrnohj	8.7059145	-4.550636	comment	3.0	11.0	1703027793	-5.902471

As soon as cheap 3rd party ink/toner became ubiquitous all of the printer manufacturers were put into an existential crisis. The most popular solution, DRM. The big boys got to it quicker than the little guys, but every one of them knew this was 100% necessary or they'd get their lunch eaten at either end (upfront sales from DRM'd devices because they are cheap and backend toner sales from remans).

Terminal graphics fit quite well within that family.WP also had pretty good support for the early laser printers, which had a wide range of ways to tell them to do stuff. Some wanted bitmaps, some built their own and you had to sent them fonts; etc. It was UGLY.IIRC they even had some drivers for optical type setter things, the old stuff that used thermal paper.

It turns out, though, that graphics programming is so hard that the majority of folk tend to use even higher level graphics libraries to write their applications.The folk writing those graphics libraries want to make their libraries as optimally performant as possible, and the abstract nature of the OpenGL API stands in the way of doing that.

On the other end of the spectrum, Microsoft Teams is almost too professional, and has an emotional association of being too corporate/formal for more pleasant use.Discord is also tougher to create group conversations easily (you need to be Friends first).

Something about the way both it and slack handle channels or groups feels clunky.	galangalalgol	7.5936394	-4.3934064	comment	3.0	12.0	1661569545	9.220293

We use it during the day to plan things, talk etc etc.It's been great to be able to go back and looks at various conversations/details/bits that were often up to two years old.I don't think we were ""freeloading"" as such, the 4 business ones she uses are all paid.  I'm a member of 3 paid slack myself.Now we need to install a second app for this sort of stuff.  As more people do that, it's going to mean more people are exposed to Slack alternatives and might move to them fully.Making things free also makes them sticky for people using them in more than one way.

On the contrary, I find it immensely irritating when others change/delete their messages, especially when I'm in the middle of reading them and writing a reply. However, instead of patching the official client, I just wrote (a read-only) one that uses their API to simply log all the messages/events that occur.I wonder if it's a difference in culture/expectations. For me, once a message is sent, I expect it to be immutable, much like basically all forms of communication have been in the past. Email, IRC, etc. all work like that. If I intend to amend or otherwise change it, I'll simply send another one or use ""correction asterisks"".

32768338	Am I understanding mesh shading corr	Am I understanding mesh shading correctly if I'm explaining it like this?In the traditional rendering pipeline you unpack triangles on the CPU, and then send them to the GPU, which then maps them to screenspace and then shades in the pixels to the screen buffer.Because of modern demands we're wanting to render insane amounts of triangles.Mesh shaders alleviate some of the bottlenecks by being a step in the pipeline on the GPU before the other steps that can generate triangles. So for example you could upload a smaller amount of triangles to the GPU, and have the mesh shaders refine that geometry by procedurally fill in the details. You could even send it not even triangles but for example the locations where you want grass, and the direction of the wind or whatever and have the mesh shader	tinco	8.737011	-4.213792	comment	3.0	10.0	1662656358	7.4020267

32784295	So, like a thermal receipt printer (	So, like a thermal receipt printer (often in 80mm width), but wider?Thermal receipts have their place. They are quite fast, and maintenance is either you replace the paper roll, or throw away the printer once its lifespan is over (usually about 50km on most entry level models), small, and cheap enough to install a bunch of them at every checkout lane, delivery driver, etc.The downside is that the prints don't last. Try putting a tape on the printed paper, and the print fades in a day or two. Even a heat as small as running a nail with mild pressure on the paper activates the ink.If this were to be a serious contender, the real innovation has to be the paper; not the printer.

As Godot continues to mature and with the right tools and support for the indie community, it's just a matter of time before there's a breakout hit built with it.Our company is building some open source game templates that will hopefully spark some cool creations with Godot 4. So far we have templates for a Streets of Rage-type beat-em-up game, a tower defense-style game, and something similar to Binding of Isaac. We're also including some high-quality art assets to go with the templates.

Thoughts so far:Godot is far from perfect. It's definitely more sparse than the others in terms of features. I've encountered some bugs (nothing show-stopping, and it's tough to say how much of that is just from using the alpha version, but it has impacted my flow). There are unfortunate quirks; for example, saving scripts always saves the whole scene, and saving large scenes can pause the editor for multiple seconds, which is a particularly annoying combination. The programming model is heavily OOP. The custom scripting language, GDScript, is a blessing and a curse; its tight integration with the engine comes at the cost of subpar tooling 	brundolf	8.474135	-3.990602	comment	3.0	33.0	1663096497	8.18796

Slack makes majority of their revenue from large organisations buying thousands of seats in one go and a native desktop client is sadly not a huge selling point for the sales team.At the end of the day Slack has to optimize for growth and there's a huge list of features that will bring more ROI than native clients which will require trebling the size of the code base.

16621158	While the above is accurrate I think	While the above is accurrate I think it's a bit one sided.Physically Based Rendering has become the dominant approach in VFX because it's a huge simplification and productivity boost. Integrating tons of special purpose hacks into one renderer isn't just hard for the renderer devs, the control parameters exposed to artists become an absolute nightmare. Combing the PBR perspective with raytracing greatly simplifies both sides of this.Not every game is trying to be the next Far Cry. Ray tracing will be adopted by teams that value that unification and simplification over getting the very last bit of performance possible by a pile of hacks. As the hardware improves, which still seems likely, we'll see the balance point of who makes that call shift in favor of tracing IMO.	jasonwatkinspdx	8.723829	-3.9443643	comment	3.0	25.0	1521482775	7.329312

We used XMPP for one-on-one IMing (we did have chat rooms but nobody used them), physical desk phones for meetings or high-bandwidth chats, and email for everything else. The current company uses Slack and Zoom for meetings.There's a big difference between the two companies in socialization and how they feel, and I put it down to Slack. The old company mainly had one-on-one chats with anything involving more people being done through well-thought-out emails, whereas this one is pretty much exclusively chat rooms.This has the effect that you talk about work and only work, as you don't have that dead time after you're	StavrosK	7.6354313	-4.422676	comment	3.0	18.0	1555077911	9.2014475

A lot of people are not in this sort of position where they can take an action like that and not be ostracized.Imagine ignoring calls or emails from your boss for a day or two when it’s clear that boss expects responses in a specific time?

The business printers in 2000 had slow processors and more ram. It was significantly bad that printing PDFs spent more time processing the file than putting toner on page.All of that, including the interfacing are not related to patents.It's not like there's some patent issue for using USB or wifi in your printer over whatever interface used in 2000 compared.Or like there's a patent on using faster processor or more RAM in your printer (two things you've mentioned also)."	coldtea	8.34905	-4.0748777	comment	3.0	15.0	1602770470	3.3030999

It works flawlessly on Linux; but it doesn’t work flawlessly on Macs, and I’ve found bug reports for the same thing going back to 2015.When you use the Mac OS built in “scanner” app to scan to PDF, it will scan in color even when you ask it to scan in B&W; unfortunately, this will confuse the app and the pdf will be corrupted.The recommended workaround is “scan in color” (which I do, and then use Ghostscript to convert to b&w), but it’s ridiculous.That said, as far as quality, speed, robustness and reliability, this is the best printer/scanner/fax machine I ever used. And it works perfectly well on Linux.	beagle3	8.328839	-4.1124725	comment	3.0	12.0	1604691623	6.810923

And ink cartridges also tend to be low cost compared to toner at the unit level. Laser printers take up more space too.The problem is if you don't print a lot, the cartridges dry out, and the ink clogs in the printer and whatever else, leading to a big pain.	toast0	8.313194	-4.0913877	comment	3.0	16.0	1604698982	6.8370085

The controller board is an Arduino and it uses commodity stepper drivers and stepper motors. The complicated specialized parts are the hot-end, which has now been somewhat standardized.Would an open source laser be out of reach?

25037217	Okay, I think lasers > inkjets for m	Okay, I think lasers > inkjets for most people. But its dangerous to generalize.Inkjets consistently make higher-resolution photos than lasers at the same price point. As you approach photo-quality, you can probably get very good photos from a $500 inkjet, and commercial quality photos from a $1000 inkjet.I don't know of any laserjet that approaches that quality. Instead, laserjets main advantage is the simpler and cheaper to use toner. At the $300 price point, laser jets are just cheaper to maintain and use over ink.--------Now there's a bunch of $100 to $200 ink printers (and laser printers) which have even worse attributes. Since most $100 printers seem to be inkjet, I think people rightfully give them a bad reputation.But at higher price points, a 11-ink printer is the only way you're 	dragontamer	8.305906	-4.0909467	comment	3.0	10.0	1604943189	6.84731

If I design a printer, whether inkjet or any other type, I probably design it to some pretty tight tolerances in terms of the ink or toner. So I probably don't want people to drop in cartridges where the manufacturing tolerances might be way off the mark as they might well cause issues with the performance. That I as the manufacturer might be asked to fix, also possibly gaining a reputation for poor quality in the process. Yes, you might reasonably point out that OEM cartridges are expensive, but it's far from a monopoly out there, isn't it? In some ways, the expense of printing could be considered to be a good thing.

I think this is due to the ray distance oscillating backwards and forwards in a way that is similar enough to neighboring rays to not appear noisy while giving the appearance of reflection.

The problem that was introduced by the compiler they used to build the print driver. To compute the paper size, margins, etc., floating point operations were used... but by then the driver had allowed the libraries that emulated the floating point processor to be unloaded, to save memory. (Due to the optimizing compiler)Any operation that involved computing the page size would crash, only if the floating point library had idled out of memory.I ended up forcing the library to be loaded at boot on all machines, and then things were stable.	mikewarot	8.331392	-4.110917	comment	3.0	13.0	1608995403	6.8831944

Since then there’s been a ton of workflows created but the (Slack) culture is still a bit weird. i think the workspace itself was created around the time of acquisition. Some teams were using Slack, but it was piecemeal at best. Some of those workspaces got folded into the workspace.1. Threads for everything everywhere, always. People are practically afraid to not use a thread, even in team channels.2. Little to no #random culture. People are afraid to meme? Maybe if you find some of the weirder channels you see it3. Terrible GUS integration. There was no GUS integration at all when I started. (GUS is Jira implemented on Salesforce).

Email clients usually have a feature to save a message to some kind of file, and I usually attach that when creating a ticket (or working with one I didn't create).My experience with Slack/Teams is like team using one email thread with the subject ""team stuff"" that they constantly reply to with fragmentary messages that are very difficult to decipher without full understanding of the context at that moment.

Unlike windows and Linux where support is handled by the GPU vendor instead.Why support Vulkan, which is arguably harder to use and takes more resources of their internal development teams, when they have an API that provides all the benefits and is arguably a better API? Especially when the major off the shelf engines already support metal. It's diminishing returns at this point.Personally I'd be quite happy to have Vulkan support on mac, but if you take a step back from your inalienable position that it's a conspiracy, there's actually very sound reasoning behind it.You may not agree with the decision, but you weaken your argument when you're trying to force everything "	dagmx	8.72903	-4.605662	comment	3.0	18.0	1560720465	-5.9752145

I'd be fine with the discussion if it was in context (a critique of Metal or even Vulkan) but threads about new Metal API features and even threads about WebGL and WebGPU are increasingly filled with the same fly-by responses about Apple's lack of support for Vulkan from people that have never used the API and are not graphics engineers. It would be much more interesting to have discussions about the merits of different approaches to raytracing in Metal vs. DXR vs. Vulkan than read the same tired half baked concerns about the existence of Metal, although it's a good chance for me to give Pjmpl more karma I guess.

I do know it's not the part where it is a chat app per se - I'm happily using Zulip, managing with Slack, and WhatsApp, Telegram and Slack all have their place. But something about the UI/UX of chatting in Discord just makes it a stream of conversations where I can barely follow what's going on.Having said that in many contexts a forum with threads that have a clear topic are just so much more of an appropriate solution than chat apps. I don't understand why people prefer the latter (although it does explain why I prefer Zulip since it manages to be a good hybrid in how it organizes discussions).	vanderZwan	7.5883183	-4.3030114	comment	3.0	10.0	1675676568	-10.965596

OpenGL has kind of always sucked compared to DirectX. There is no reason for Microsoft to abandon 25+ years of support because finally we have a competitive open standard for Direct3D.And on that note, you are just complaining about Direct3D. There are a ton of DirectX APIs for things that aren't graphics, like sound (XAudio), raytracing (DXR), storage (DirectStorage), machine learning (DirectML), and many more. Vulkan doesn't really attempt most of these other DirectX features. So... you're asking Microsoft to abandon Direct3D for Vulkan, and have everyone use a Vulkan/DirectX hybrid, which sounds awful.	gjsman-1000	8.720443	-4.6065674	comment	3.0	10.0	1676328433	-5.9604874

The best part about it was you would buy a toner cartridge and when it would tell you it’s getting low, put some electrical tape over the clear hole in the side and it would continue to print for another 1.5k.

(I'm kind of partial to wide format printers because schematics printed on them are easier on the eyes).That said, a really interesting startup would be an open source inkjet printer. (All the necessary patents have expired ones that are current revolve mostly around cartridges or cleaning systems). I suspect it is a kind of niche market as my kids tell me that ""nobody prints things, we have it on our phone!"" which I kind of understand, but point out you don't need multiple monitors to do code development if you have listing printed out :-)."

The last notable feture: tabloid size ink jets came out a decade ago. Printers still have paper handling issues, and inkjets still waste tons of ink unclogging print heads. All the innovation goes into lock-in and marketing strategies for consumables. The silver lining is that most printers have a Linux drivers these days.I was a big advocate of Brother printers, but the last one I bought in 2020 has been plagued with paper jams and the cyan ink leeched into the yellow internal tank.

Instant ink, on the other hand, offers 100 pages for $6/month, making it about $20 to achieve the same yield of pages.And with the rise of digital records, most people could probably live on the $1/month plan where you get 10 pages and can rollover up to 30 pages with every extra 10 pages costing $1 when you need it. It'd take 3 years of not printing a total of 315 pages to lose money on Instant Ink compared to the price of the new cartridge (I'm on the grandfathered $1 15 pages/month plan).	judge2020	8.310332	-4.113361	comment	3.0	10.0	1691195654	6.8706856

Rewriting is obviously difficult, starting new projects is somewhat easier. The main issue I see is the Unity asset store ecosystem is completely different and provides massive amounts of functionality for current games, which Godot doesn't yet have much of.I've tried Godot a few times and basic stuff like export to web didn't work at all out of the box, and it felt like alpha quality stuff. I would however like it to succeed.Unity also has extensive documentation and training and it's an established tool for game devs who then migrate to industry jobs like industrial process/environment simulations.

Zulip as a product is way better than Slack and could have either ""won"" or influenced Slack and competitors to adopt a better conversation model.Of course, nothing is stopping that from happening today, but by the time Zulip was refounded and regained momentum, several critical years had passed in between and Slack was much further ahead in market share.Having used Zulip, Slack is now literally painful to use, especially at scale."	chimeracoder	7.5730734	-4.422553	comment	3.0	18.0	1685559221	-10.998564

That roller has to be up to temperature to print.  It is normally heated by a powerful (ie. 1 kilowatt) light bulb inside a hollow roller.    Sometimes if you peek through the vents in the printer, you can actually see the light it makes.The light bulb is pulsed on and off to maintain the right temperature - but when coming out of standby it is solidly on for ~10 seconds.   Manufacturers want their printers to warm up from standby quickly, so they put very powerful heaters in them, even though the steady state heat requirement isn't awfully much while printing.	londons_explore	8.315333	-4.090274	comment	3.0	22.0	1687201368	6.8691626

Impression Products won this case, and the suit says that patent rights end once the cartridge is sold to a consumer.I can see that this could be a landmark case in the future when one of those Right-To-Repair laws (like the one in Nebraska(?)) if the specific reason manufacturers don"	yladiz	8.325194	-4.0813203	comment	3.0	14.0	1496371715	6.808308

It's priced entirely by monthly page count; IIRC the first 100 pages per month are included in the base fee ($3 a month, last I checked), and you pay an extra $1 for every 10 pages in a given month. Since it's a subscription, they just tack on the extra charges after the fact. (I think the extra page rate, at least, depends on plan; trust their pricing info over mine, ofc.)In exchange for the subscription, your printer automatically requests replacement ink cartridge sets to be shipped whenever the installed set runs low. That doesn't cost extra, and if there's a rate threshold past which it stops happening, I've never hit it.Ultimately, this works out, by design, as a terrible deal for printing documents, sold entirely on the idea of convenience.

A particularly shiny shield, a campfire, etc. And then the rest of the scene is"	brundolf	8.735712	-3.95007	comment	3.0	12.0	1599083171	7.4215074

33937456	Unfortunately, consumers are price s	Unfortunately, consumers are price sensitive beings even if it doesn’t make sense. We prefer cheaper upfront costs even if it costs more in the long term. For example, a decent toner printer can cost $300 plus $75/cartridge later on. But the $50 printer works “just as well” and has “only” $50 cartridges, so it’s “cheaper” (ignoring pages/cartridge). This leads to a big race-to-the-bottom (like airline seat prices[a]) that makes margins razor-thin. As such, the manufacturers price gouge you on the ink.[a]: Everyone complains about airline seat spacing, but nothing short of regulation will fix it because the margins are too thin to not pack everyone like sardines.

That ""max height"" is a zbuffer of sorts for each ray. [edit: I just read further down and they mention this]Also, you want to render each ray/vertical screen line one at a time, rather than running each single step of the ray for all rays/vertical lines.Once you are rendering each ray at once, it's easy to do a circular rather than flat projection, which feels a lot more stable when you rotate and admits higher fields of view without distortion."

Video conference is better, but is less spontaneous and makes it harder to pull someone else into the conversation. Above all, text and video eliminate serendipity - I won't overhear the the conversation my colleagues are having about a pain-point I solved 2 days ago. I don't think channels on slack can ever replace this for me - following a text discussion takes my full attention, unlike people talking within earshot.	sangnoir	7.623454	-4.330651	comment	4.0	18.0	1482355849	9.201371

here's mine: http://mee6bot.com :) .
You can read a short article I wrote recently about it: https://medium.com/@anis.blk/the-mvp-that-got-to-480k-unique... .Transcript:Last March, in my little darky flat somewhere in the middle of France, I had this idea to launch a little chat bot in a platform called Discord. I was coding all day long to deliver a functional and satisfying version of what I had in mind. These were the most profitable 3 days of my life…Discord is a slack-like application. The main difference between slack and discord is that discord is made for gamers. It’s free, easy to use and has gamers oriented features like a great and reliable voice communication feature.
The platform was crowed with a lot of chat bots. But those were very rigide, and kind of complex to setup. "	cookkkie	7.598782	-4.317838	comment	4.0	15.0	1483624745	9.245994

It has a handful of very interesting product decisions, like threaded replies and iframe apps.The cons : MS Teams is not as polished as Slack, the UI (especially of the chat area) is not as clear. The installation/onboarding is not as fluid. They have less apps and integrations (obviously, this is just the beginning).My guess : MS Teams will not even begin to make a dent in the almost 100% market share of Slack among startups, agencies and similar small, agile groups.

Notably, it doesn't support escaping, and it has weird issues with certain special characters (for example, it can't render the string `a|b` as in-line code because it contains a pipe).* The cost for the paid version is really steep if your project/organisation is on a limited budget.

Probably DirectX. I think the idea is to sort out an API that would be compatible between all three due to Microsoft and Apple _both_ not wanting to officially support Vulkan over their own platforms in their browsers, regardless of the support at the OS level.	zbuttram	8.6959095	-4.6123304	comment	4.0	50.0	1486511939	-5.934877

If anything, we need to focus on killing faxing and paper as a medium once and for all.Sure, there may always (or at least long) be a need for hard-copy for some applications, but it hardly strikes me as sufficient to drive need for innovation in printers.	unclebucknasty	8.343773	-4.048425	comment	4.0	30.0	1473681588	6.776753

Indeed, the press release says something slighthy different: ""Today, HP is investing to disrupt this category by replacing copiers with superior multifunction printer (MFP) technology."" Basically, they want to replace the copier industry with printers, bringing the exact same crap you complain about to a whole new market segment. (Most photocopiers are already just digital scanners coupled to printers internally. They just want to replace them with cheaper, worse ones.)"	makomk	8.347166	-4.0943985	comment	4.0	61.0	1473679841	6.8503838

It's just that it has been mostly on the side of reducing per-unit manufacturing costs. I recently took apart a modern HP inkjet and was surprised to find for instance that stepper motors have been replaced with DC motors and optical encoders.	avian	8.331429	-4.069822	comment	4.0	27.0	1473682179	6.783282

In the beginning it was all Skype, then we switched to Ventrilo and PhpBB, then many went to FB for text, then to Teamspeak for voice, then to Slack for text again, and now Discord for both text and voice.The needs of the community didn't really change. They wanted persistent chat for text and images, put up announcements to guide new players, have votes/elections, and use team voice chats during play sessions. Each combination above solved those problems, each with its own unique benefits and drawbacks. Mumble's use cas	belorn	7.6185174	-4.217585	comment	4.0	12.0	1553620491	9.246249

OpenGL 4.0 was released in 2010, and since then changes have been incremental. We more or less have figured out how to do raster graphics (ray tracing may be a different story), so it made sense to invest tens (hundreds?) of millions of dollars to develop the Vulkan spec, and then many millions more to implement it.What other technologies are there were we are more or less at the end game?

Some people where I work book meetings with themselves to guarantee focused distraction-free time.  That's completely valid.Part of being a professional is setting boundaries, communicating them, setting the expectations that the r	Falkon1313	7.688698	-4.4924574	comment	4.0	16.0	1645171533	9.047146

But in the meantime, we know SSAO is a hack. We know it doesn't look physically correct, we only use it because (if done well) it looks better than the alternative, which is no ambient occlusion, or ambient occlusion only on static models.	esperent	8.694438	-3.9576707	comment	4.0	27.0	1646705405	7.4778314

With a PBRT style renderer, everything is handled in a single monte carlo framework. And once you get an unbiased renderer that meets your standards, you can implement schemes like irradiance caching or photon mapping that introduce bias, but greatly accelerate rendering (and reduce noise). That optimization can be done once, for everything past and future.That's why I'm saying the combination of PBR and tracing is a huge productivity boon to both sides, art and tech. It has a performance cost, but if/when hardware can pay that cost in real time, games absolutely will use it.	jasonwatkinspdx	8.728992	-3.9629805	comment	4.0	13.0	1521495892	7.346768

I love the concept so much.With the others, I've still got three Pebbles and I love them all equally. The two OG Pebbles needed a piece of paper between the vibrating part and the screen, but the 2HR has been perfect.These concepts are all so great.

That's roughly what I'm wishing for, and is how I've described what I want before.Does anyone here have hands-on experience with Braid?More generally, are there other tools you've used or heard of that might fall into that category?"

They were sidelined so-so features. Hell, on Slack you couldn't even see screen sharing from mobile, and you did not even got a notification that another person is sharing. Never mind missing even the most basic annotation features.No wonder Zoom eats all the pies now. Sure, they made a lot of mistakes, but it was a huge landfall on a small(ish) company. That said, if the others top up their game, I'm happy to get rid of an additional app - but that's how market works.	poisonborz	7.7169003	-4.4259796	comment	4.0	12.0	1587127121	-9.762704

For multiplayer games, that implies that Ray Tracing may never show details (such as a reflection of an enemy) that would give a strategical advantage.Plus the real issue with contemporary game development is that consoles make a majority of the revenue (due to less piracy) but they choke when you have 50k+ polygon	fxtentacle	8.705766	-4.000749	comment	4.0	18.0	1589200710	7.4405656

In general, I think Discord has the best audio and video service that I've used, especially kicking Zoom to the curb.	jjice	7.6042767	-4.357426	comment	4.0	19.0	1609779712	9.284128

Teams definitely smells of Microsoft trying to compete where it can.To be fair, those are two different paradigms, and both are needed simultaneously. This alone makes Teams better than Discord and Slack, both of which - last I checked on them (~3 years ago for the former, and ~6 months for the latter) - try to shoehorn long-lived multiplayer threads into a sequential chat format.Maybe it is anticompetitive in some ways, but out of the trio mentioned above, Teams seems to be the only one to avoid the fate of becoming the communication platform where knowledge goes to die.

It works fine when there is a small amount of information that needs to be shared by a small amount of people (say, less than twenty). I find it is really poorly suited for it when you have more people than that and information to be shared.The biggest Slack I have been on was I think close to 10,000 people.  The team that set it up envisioned it to be the place for everything, but it was a big mess.  Perhaps separate instances were needed.A better approach is to make an existing knowledge base work well within Slack.  This is something that Microsoft Teams is trying to do, but still doesn't do completely effectively.	hahamrfunnyguy	7.651425	-4.4448633	comment	4.0	16.0	1691594811	9.184115

This is something that lends itself naturally to gaming but their real success was getting the quality so high that it feels like you are carrying on a conversation in real life.Everything else was secondary, but essential, it's like getting the toppings right on the pizza. Essential, but secondary.Because gaming has this unique use case and the fact that there are millions of gamers, created a fantastic beachhead which continues to expand.However, outside of the core demographic of gaming it certainly hasn't gained much exposure.	raiyu	7.5901265	-4.2368555	comment	4.0	18.0	1603136231	9.228835

I can agree with you in this case because I've got the Brother DCP-L2540DW. I got it on sale for $99 CAD (~$75 USD) when it was still the newest model available. I'm using the stock cartridge still, though I have a refill purchased and ready to go in case it's not possible to buy one when the original powder runs out.This line of Brother printers is indeed good. It's impossible to say whether this applies generally to any laser printer, or to any Brother laser printer, or if we were simply lucky to have picked up these particular models.	developer2	8.308225	-4.1089005	comment	4.0	12.0	1604445051	6.7950854

Then one day I needed it for a school project, with all its colors due to some graphs.Printed a simple test page with some colors twice, then the colors were back in action. Successfully printed 20 or so color pages after that without issue.So clearly inkjets that doesn't dry out was a solved problem, however I realize that doesn't exactly drive ink or printer sales so yeah.These days I just have a monochrome laser printer at home for the two-three times a year I need it.

Had to muck about with refills, blank chips and ink systems for years until the happy day when the thing broke and I threw it as hard as I could into the e-waste skip.The rot set in with printers when the technology got good enough for there not to be any  easy improvements and the mindset changed from building a tool to help people create, to seeing customers as a resource to be exploited.Every user-hostile bit of nonsense from shoddy software to region-locked, staggeringly overpriced ink 	mattkevan	8.319352	-4.1042557	comment	4.0	14.0	1604448896	6.830638

The only way to use the scanner was using the horribly bloated third party scanning software, that was basically useless for document scanning (but it did allow you to draw a hat on the photo of your dog!).

Slack is pretty good and has some nice features but not really anything a big Acme corp can't copy.

While you can be signed into multiple orgs in Teams, switching orgs literally restarts the program which means that switching from your org to a client's org is super disruptive.

Although I do worry that with a huge funding round it will bring more employees and those employees will need stuff to do.  There's only so much you can do with a chat platform, and Slack eeked out a ton of value out of it early on.  What I'm seeing now is features being added or reworked seemingly just so someone has something to do.  I see Apple falling into this pattern too (mDNSresponder being replaced by DiscoveryD for example).For example, IMHO one of Slack's best features from the beginning was on the iOS app when you clicked the button to upload a photo you were presented with ""Last Photo Taken"", ""Camera Roll"", or ""Take a photo"".

If you need to talk to a large group of people about a project, it'll be more efficient to (gasp) have a meeting. Recording/itemizing data in a slack channel is horrible and basically unsearchable after a few days.The nature of slack forces people to always ""watch"" for pings and channel updates, lest they get labeled a slacker for not responding. It's a 24-hour long meeting with no agenda, no guidelines, no leadership, and the occasional guy who jumps into the room with a bad joke.Total mess."	matchbok	7.6482925	-4.4345737	comment	4.0	22.0	1530713316	9.132529

Things like Slack, Discord (and open alternatives like Riot) are not good systems for support forums, or any sort of community that should be visible by the public. They make it impossible to find answers with search engines like Google, impossible for archiving services to back them up in case things go down and force users to register to simply find any help given to others.They're terrible systems for this pur	CM30	7.634	-4.1994963	comment	4.0	25.0	1531683729	4.3466187

On top of that people get stuck on old versions of your product, which you then need to support as well because they payed you a premium for it. With SAAS you just have one version to worry about: the current one. So I don't expect Slack will be very eager to do on premise installations any time soon. The whole point of Slack is not doing that. In the same way, on site salesforce installations are not a thing, or on site Google docs. Even MS is moving away from on premise with office 365.

Slack can roll out new features just by assigning a couple developers to it, and Signal has to coordinate new cryptographic research --- not just new cryptographic research, but research that produces something deployable at scale within the resources of a project like Signal! --- so Slack (and Wire and Keybase) are at a permanent advantage here.But over time, Signal gets more and more usable without having to consider tradeoffs.	tptacek	7.629139	-4.4545937	comment	4.0	34.0	1575914608	9.234968

39089971	Consumer printers are a dying market	Consumer printers are a dying market, in case you havent noticed. Sales are trending down roughly 25% over the past decade. HP itself has seen its printer revenue drop from $29B in 2008 to $18B last year. Unit sales have seen a similar decline.This is what desperation looks like. Nothing they can do will reverse the trend--its bigger than a single company. HP has its numbers to hit.. but are completely powerless to make it grow. So they do things like this, trying to slow the decline for themselves personally... but push more consumers away, accelerating the trend and the decline of their business.I think the model is starting to show its cracks.. the old model was: buy a printer at a discount, pay us for ink. But if consumers are printing less, they're buying less ink, making it even hard	rgbrenner	8.347217	-4.102795	comment	4.0	22.0	1705934439	6.8444223

Make it configurable! That’s ok. The weird chat-as-forum thing is fine for a very low-traffic announcements channel (and very bad for anything else) so having it as an option is alright.2) Allow “create a meeting for this Teams channel” that puts any meeting chat directly in the channel.These two problems force conversations away from the “Team” and into meeting-specific chats and DMs. It’s really, really bad.

While Vulkan makes some of these features optional, the missing features are required to layer DirectX and OpenGL on top. No existing solution on M1 gets past the OpenGL 4.1 feature set.> How do we break the 4.1 barrier? Without hardware support, new features need new tricks. Geometry shaders, tessellation, and transform feedback become compute shaders. Cull distance becomes a transformed interpolated value. Clip control becomes a vertex shader epilogue. The list goes on.

Between those incidents were always some weeks were nothing happened, but when it happened it affected a lot of printer rooms.In the end we found a monthly cronjob on a central printing server which triggered a testpage print on all connected printers.

Just about every single org I've ever worked at prioritized a more extraverted work environment.

I have a very hard time getting through this, but as  the founder of a Europe-based messaging company (https://talkjs.com), I wonder whether this is trouble.En-to-end encryption is great but it also kills quite a number of use cases. For example, our group conversations couldn't be e2e encrypted because then users can't see the message history from before they joined it. In whatsapp this is indeed the case, but for our platform it is a core feature. Same for Slack, I suppose. Similarly, Slack search would be totally out of the door. (unless, again, you make it only search the stuff sent to you)	skrebbel	7.631429	-4.495162	comment	4.0	20.0	1497760852	9.194943

There was no way to filter notifications beyond ""Everything"", so that little bubble would go up every time anybody in the company pressed a key.  And heaven forbid somebody typed ""Good morning, @channel"" (which happened 20 times per morning per timezone), because then you'd get the dreaded Red Exclamation Mark in the tab.I can't fathom how anybody would have been able to work if they had gone as far as allowing notifications to be turned on and make noises at them every time Slack thought something Important Enough To Interrupt You had"	jasonkester	7.65127	-4.456278	comment	4.0	35.0	1497877978	9.189107

I used to wait for someone to post if I knew a message was coming. Now I can drop in and out of a channel more easily. Similarly, I've muted almost all the channels I'm in so now I only need to check if someone notifies me.The point I'm making is that Slack doesn't necessarily work the way you want right away, and that you might need address a few cultural problems with the way your team uses it.

People in our company made all these integrations to paste back emojis into GitHub comments, to create a new ci run and all sorts of things. Honestly, It was all very irritating to be in love with a tool this way. Sort of like forcing emacs to do everything (peace be upon emacs).Thankfully it all came to a head when the buggy deploy bot made a broken deploy and we started using it just for plain chat and moved to free plan because we didn't want history on purpose.	simplehuman	7.5945234	-4.4261966	comment	4.0	23.0	1497932649	9.265938

At some point, this special yellow ink must become depleted, right?Or does it use the regular ink which is provided by the printer's cartridge? If this is the case, isn't a possible defense to just not buy new color cartridges? At least for me, I have to print colored documents at most every 3 months. Unfortunately the color cartridges dries out after about 6 months which means I would have to pay $20 to print less then 10 pages. Thus, I only buy the black ones and when I have to print something in color, I just put it on a USB stick and print it at work (I am allowed to do that in moderate amounts) or go to a shop with printing services and pay $1 for those documents.Since my color cartridges are almost two years old (and still f	Matt3o12_	8.318666	-4.079361	comment	4.0	12.0	1498318470	6.8391156

On the other, slackers are like the perfectionists who never get anything done because they never resolved their analysis-paralysis.There are very few who are exactly in the middle of the spectrum.

Or if the chip controlling the fax functions was unresponsive, it may not scan, copy or print.Designing a device which can self test every component, and then have a matrix of exactly which components must be present and working to do each function is very possible...   but it's extra engineering effort, extra testing, and an extra source of bugs"	londons_explore	8.34963	-4.09392	comment	4.0	12.0	1634398544	6.827651

34616658	Streaming functionality isn’t chat, 	Streaming functionality isn’t chat, though. AMD gives you the option to not install streaming functionality when you install their drivers and I’m pretty sure they target gamers too.It reminds me of the age of Windows bloatware.Trying to pile all the ingredients on a single piece of bread does not a good sandwich make. On the contrary, it leaves me with an impression that they have to rely on the brand recognition and snowball effect of previous products.I would probably hold their software in higher regard if it wasn’t just one monolithic multi-tool. They don’t even have to push multiple apps, but could use a modular architecture at the app level with plug-ins to support non-core functionality.	kefka_p	7.664095	-4.1422753	comment	4.0	13.0	1675281441	7.104073

Does no one really care that much?

That sounds like some pretty high-order manufacturing is needed, I'm not drilling that out in the shed.Perhaps the best bet would be to find a commercially available printer (laser or inkjet) and reverse engineer it, perhaps replacing the control board with a Raspberry Pi or something more suitable (ESP32?) to drive the existing electro-mechanical components with an open firmare.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkjet_printing#Continuous_ink...	unwind	8.343007	-3.9986014	comment	4.0	16.0	1675763453	-9.222002

Most of the chat and messaging systems in use today are also proprietary and closed. So are most video-conferencing systems and the codecs they use.This one in particular worries me.

I worry about every open source project moving to github / slack, where we may not have nearly as good a record of conversations that formed the software in 20 - 30 years.On the other hand you won't see any argument from me that these services provide an easier workflow than what existed before, and maybe that easier workflow opening development up to a wider community is more important.	jonawesomegreen	7.5950537	-4.3990746	comment	5.0	44.0	1557343463	9.341486

I would add that, despite all of them being low-level, Metal is quite easier than the other two, and DirectX 12 is also easier than Vulkan, despite having very similar concepts and ideas. This is in part due to API decisions and differences in verbosity, in part due to the ""easier"" ones having less flexibility. If your ultimate goal is to master Vulkan, starting with another can help. Also: OpenGL and DirectX are easier than those 3.If I were learning those APIs today, I would personally start with either OpenGL, Metal or DirectX 11 (or 12 if you're slightly braver). They can give someone lots of insights that one can use when learning Vulkan.Like other people mentioned, WebGPU or WebGL are also more straightforward and a good starting point."	whstl	8.704587	-4.6151233	comment	5.0	63.0	1697033545	-5.925391

There seems to be a sentiment that pops up every now and again that it’s a shame that content in discord communities is getting “walled off” and inaccessible by google and others from the rest of the internet. That is a strange sentiment to me. Discord communities are private by design. If the server owners want public discourse, there are many options for that. Are these same people upset that there aren’t microphones at every table in restaurants so that those conversations aren’t “walled off” from anyone not in the restaurant?

E.g., if I run a Matrix server instance, it's mine to administer, manage, destroy, etc. If I start a Discord ""server"" it's a glorified chat room or set of chat rooms owned and maintained by the company.Language is powerful and helps shape our world, and by redefining ""server"" to mean a segmented part of someone else's website, it's another"	manifoldgeo	7.581133	-4.2634044	comment	5.0	16.0	1665526222	9.296836

Postscript, for example, is surprisingly complex to implement in practice, which leads to a lot of inexpensive network printers actually lacking postscript support. Further, printers are very slow at rasterizing, and so while support for PDF rasterization is very common you probably don't want to use it.

So the fact that all the pieces existed doesn't count for very much in the end.Nor was it obvious that if someone put it together properly it would achieve commercial success. I was theoretically in the right place at the right time to have put together something like Slack at my job, but there was no desire to invest enough to do that and eventually the entire product was EOL'ed a couple of years before Slack was released, not just because the product itself was not doing well but the entire market segment was not doing well. Commercial IM products have not done well historically, because it was difficult to do enough better than the free stuff to get people to pay.What	jerf	7.638574	-4.4697227	comment	5.0	20.0	1478190822	9.200409

I guess it's one of those things people start using when there's a handful of employees and then they just get stuck with it.The worst feature about Slack is its ""threads"" feature. You're effectively manically thread chasing or you just have to learn to not care about past conversations.The other annoying thing was input lag when typing sometimes. It was completely unpredictable when it happens (wasn't pc load, browser wasn't that busy, but i didn't check the profiler; internet was fine). It would come and go on its own. Not everyone had it either, and it seemed to be isolated to Linux machines.We demoed Zulip, but some people didn't like that one because the UI is...

We go from our quietest time of the whole year to one of our biggest days quite literally overnight.What's interesting is that when this happened, some HN comments suggested it was the return from holiday traffic that caused it.

I understand why people would like that, but it still bothers the shit out of me.I work for MS so we have to use Teams, but I'd prefer opt-in to threads vs. threads by default. I fully understand and accept that my way isn't going to be the way for everyone, but when looking for a community chat option for friends, we uninstalled zulip in less than a day and ended up going with matrix. That didn't work super well for us at the time so we went with Mattermost, which much closer aligns to our chat preferences.The good news is there are tons of options for people to choose what fits best for them!

I used to be an avid user (loved the way some integrations could help productivity), but since then moved on to Discord, which feels superior in every aspect, especially since it's free.I'm not sure how I feel about the valuation. I'd like to see how the user base, especially the ratio of paying users, has been growing. It feels likely that most of the companies that would have been easy to convert have already been converted. I expect CAC to go up and payer conversion to stagnate at best. I don't see how they can 2-3x their revenue this year (unless there are drastic, risky changes).In addition, the slow iterations on the mobile and desktop clients, and the meteoric rise of Discord are enough cause for concern.

Another huge plus is that it's not Electron garbage like the official Slack and Discord clients, so you don't have to effectively run one or two other entire web browsers just to do a bit of chatting. On the other hand, it is Qt garbage instead, so it still doesn't integrate with macOS's look and feel very well, and a long-standing bug is that when disconnecting my laptop from a wired ethernet connection, it doesn't automatically reconnect everything once the system switches over to wifi. Neither of these have stopped me from preferring it over the official clients, though. I recommend anyone not satisfied with the crus	Cyberdog	7.595895	-4.3807244	comment	5.0	23.0	1568304493	9.265964

Gloria's slack is just to make sure that Tony, the CEO, doesn't have any slack: he's working all the time on whatever he thinks is highest priority, and never takes a break. And Gloria is not using her slack to think about ways to reinvent the organization to make it better. In other words, this central example is actually not an example of the benefits of slack: it's an example of efficiency--Tony works at peak efficiency and has no slack.

I've tried this when writing my own path tracer in a programming project (not cyberpunk) for simple monochrome spheres.

Quickly scheduling a real meeting (occasionally it can replace the meeting if it's just two participants, but I've not seen this be consistently successful past two).2.

Okay, clearly not working well. I had to copy and paste 5 times to get ~15 lines of text because if you scrolled at all it somehow deselected some portion of the text.I mean, honestly, what tool doesn't even let you easily copy the conversation?

Early Twitter is another example where Jack Dorsey and coworkers used AOL AIM for workplace chat.

Slack and Discord each have competent internal searches, after you've joined a particular server, but they're utter black boxes to the outer world.I can point to several niches (mostly gaming, by inclination) where there is virtually no conversation outside of a Discord. Unless you find the appropriate server, you have no peers to share with, learn from. Even if you do find that server, you start running into structural problems for information sharing: Discord's only mechanisms for permanent content are a scrollable list of pinned messages, or admin-only archive channels.

They'll be looking for opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenue and they don't much care if that means losing a lot of users who aren't making them much money. For all the users but the biggest users, this is a sign that you should start looking around for other options.	aeturnum	7.642376	-4.461663	comment	5.0	25.0	1661557371	9.223666

While, Slack is well within their rights to _ask_ you not to modify their user experience, it's short sighted of them to do so.With ZenHub, we worked with them even closer because we saw that our users were happier using GitHub + ZenHub. We made it super clear that UI changes would likely break their app but that would be a risk for them to evaluate. In the end, it worked out well since ZenHub invested alot in their UI and became a long term partner of GitHub's.From a technical level, I'd also take issue with this. You're customizing the output of their services once it's in the browser at the request of the user.

Even if you have one office, people should be free to work from home. Side chats get lost, people forget or don't hear. Slack is public and searchable. No mumbling and if you mistype, you can fix it. Plus you can add documents, links, images while you're talking.People say getting communication on their phones is like an anchor to their desk but I feel the exact opposite. It means I can leave my desk anytime I want and not be out of communication.

Suffice it to say I stopped thinking about discord.py and switched to a thin layer with discord.js to python.This gist doesn't really help my view of the scene, it confuses me more and adds to the drama. The changes look great, the future plans look great, but discord.js already had (at least) slash commands and better documentation. Staying with js seems safer, more time efficient, and more drama free to me at the moment even if it's a bit awkward.	falsenapkin	7.5926533	-4.255303	comment	5.0	29.0	1646534885	9.271925

We were constantly reminded by Google how big the YouTube integration would be, which unique killer features we absolutely had to integrate with, and more.And non of that ever materialized after launch. If Google can't even convince their own internal teams to cooperate, how do they expect studios and consumers to care the slightest for their product.It also didn't help that supporting Stadia was equivalent to supporting an entirely different new console in scope, except less battle tested and much more buggy. Meanwhile all their competitors allow existing console or Windows builds to be shipped to their platforms.And while we're sharing anecdotes, this was a fun one.

Even if only one in a thousand people leave reviews, that suggests a revenue of only $2500 or so, or more like $1750 after steam takes their cut.

Unity does none of that, at least nothing that counts. Godot is a bit better than Unity because it's open-source so contributors are often contributing to things they use and want to improve, but it's still got weird opinions at a maintainer level and severe performance downfalls from those opinions.We're considering another renderer, but for the time being we're still tepidly okay with Godot.	cptcobalt	8.47269	-3.9738476	comment	5.0	47.0	1659716349	8.143259

The priciest plan includes an HP OfficeJet Pro rental and 700 printed pages for $35.99 per month.”So their low-volume plan is 35¢/page, scaling down to 5¢/page. That’s obscene, but not surprising. Corporate greed has been HP’s stock-in-trade for many years now.So ironic that they call the printer “Envy.” It’s been decades since I envied anyone with an HP printer.	sonofhans	8.311588	-4.1073046	comment	6.0	21.0	1709248241	6.874584

Ray tracing is what requires a lot of computation and has everything to do with physics. Somewhere in between are hybrid methods: rasterization with ray tracing components added to it, or ray tracing with approximations.For instance, pure rasterization cannot do shadows. It is approximated by rendering the scene from the viewpoint of a light and test the rasterized scene for occlusions casting shadows. And the other way around: real time ray tracing cannot compute all indirect lighting paths, a subset is only considered at the cost of e.g. variance.	rollulus	8.6880245	-3.993314	comment	6.0	33.0	1537971709	7.4049807

I kept all notifications off, and checked it whenever I had a few minute break or wanted to catch up on our office's conversation.Slack allowed anyone to contact me by tagging me or @here, so it was obvious when someone wanted it to be synchronous (therefore breaking my communication), but the grand majority of communication was asynchronous unlike email - which does a poor job of differentiating between messages that should (and shouldn't) break attention.	sidhanthp	7.63409	-4.4534965	comment	6.0	21.0	1539293916	9.233096

In fact ray tracing cannot do global illuminuation and any ray tracing engine that does that is essentially including a hack on top of its core ray tracer. You can even look at the images shared in the article and see for yourself as to how realistic or unrealistic they look.Path tracing is not good for 'real-time' computer graphics at the moment, because GPUs need to be still more computationally powerful, though I think 2018 or 2019 is the year we'll have the first computer game	fizixer	8.718131	-4.0282445	comment	6.0	32.0	1533271908	7.445241

The project took off and was added to hundreds of thousands of groups by Kik users.Two days ago, Ted Livingston announced the closure and Kik has been chaos throughout ever since, with people adopting Discord and Telegram to retain their online friend circles.One way in which Kik stood out from other popular chat clients was the ability to search for public groups. Even though this feature came with some amount of darkness, people could easily find peers with common interests and make friends.It's a real shame that this platform has to go.

For example, if you get a notification in mail and it's in a thread, you can't jump to it, clicking the link dumps you into the channel and you are left wondering.

Now, Slack means it's much easier to put anyone on blast, and it's much harder to control the narrative. Combined with the pandemic, where all socialization happens through these tools, and old corporate cultures are disappearing. Apple is probably one of those that relied on in-person culture more than most.

Also relevant is the fact that said AWS product or IT charges would be borne anyhow.I think dividing between 'productivity/IT' kind of spending, and product-related services would reallly help, also, comparing that $10K to historical, non-SaaS numbers would help as well.	jariel	7.652402	-4.4495864	comment	6.0	18.0	1583430281	9.187427

Sure, some of the stuff is pretty hard to check like device memory addresses. But just this week I had the validation layer blow up spectacularly because I simply dared to give it an unrealistically high index for a vertex binding and the layer attempted to resize its internal state tracking array for vertex bindings to accomodate that.Vulkan has another fun aspect to it: the application doesn't have full control over the layer loading mechanisms in the mandatory driver wrapper.

From at least some manufacturers the ones that were available were selling for at least $50-100 above MSRP depending on models, or you could order at normal prices (don't bother looking for discounts!) with estimated delivery end of May or in June.

What I do see is that more and more communities switch from IRC to Slack as the primary ""sync"" channel (while still maintaining mailing lists, bug trackers and the like).And as much as I hate it, the success can't be denied. Especially when looking at some conferences I've been to over the years. If they even had an IRC channel, it was mostly dead, but the Slack channels were buzzing with activity during the conference.

The goal is to create ephemeral, real-time communities (like this thread).  I find discord too exclusionary to bring strangers together.  And reddit is not dynamic enough to encourage relationship formation.  With this site, you post a thread, people start chatting, there's a simple interface for groups of people to break off the public chat and go into a private chat or into a webrtc call.  Once the thread loses momentum the chat room sort of dies.  And people move onto the next thread.Backend is written in Go.  Frontend will likely be Elm.  Redis for pubsub.

They had a laser printer called the SPARCPrinter that did all the rasterization on the workstation - which made the printer very inexpensive, but it bogged down the workstation when printing.We often played flight simulator after work (ok, sometimes during work) where you could fly an F-15 and go shoot your buddy out of the sky.There was a sys admin (Keith) who was an absolute ace. If Keith got on your tail you were basically dead. Keith would win all the time.But Keith had a weakness. The SPARCprinter was attached to his workstation....So if Keith got on your tail, we discovered that we could send a nice big print job to his workstation. That was usually enough to shake him from your tail and escape.Th	wstrange	8.34834	-4.075104	comment	6.0	75.0	1604454442	6.746501

Honestly I think Salesforce will lose that battle; Microsoft's Word/Excel monopoly is unbreakable.

I use it when teammates do, and acknowledge it's useful sometimes, but I would prefer not to have that feature.Discord also does not have threads. I've heard some complaints about it, but not many.Threads in Zulip seem to change it into a different kind of app. I don't see how the Slack workspaces that I've used heavily would work with it. There are about 15 channels in my sidebar. Making them nested would turn it into 75, assuming 5 threads per channel. Perhaps there wouldn't need to be as many top-level channels with Zulip threads, but it makes it into a whole different paradigm. They are also missing Slack-style threads.

When everybody knows each other and is focused on the same goal, it's not hard to work out good communication and space-use norms. But scaling that up into large open-plan offices can quickly turn maddening. It's the tragedy of the audio commons, and anybody can walk up and tap you on the shoulder.For me Slack is the same problem, but worse in that it removes some of they physical signals and feedback mechanisms that work in an open-plan office.	wpietri	7.6451707	-4.451492	comment	6.0	18.0	1607979612	9.169147

I hope that any cloud streaming service that still exists learns from this and ensures that player's data is more portable so in the event that they must shut down, this same problem doesn't crop up again."	least	8.703597	-4.1047916	comment	6.0	34.0	1664546220	14.432634

Artifacts were noticeable but not enough for me to care. If I bought my own gaming PC later, I would be able to continue playing the game there. GeForce Now offered ""Hey, you're playing Cyberpunk at 720p@25fps? Wanna play at 1080p@60fps for $10? And you can leave any time"" And I said heck yes.Stadia would have denied me the ability to continue playing on my own machine while charging me even more money.

Their solution was anything but, and it was truly innovative (at the time) and their success was well deserved.I do agree that they’re victims of their early success, but rather that it proves that it’s rather difficult to make multiple successful products.When you own a whole ecosystem, like Microsoft and Apple do, it makes it much easier to do; you can also see this in case of Google Maps. You can just push your products inside the ecosystem, and be almost guaranteed success.Stadia drifted away from that ecosystem (as does Google Cloud for that matter), and as such is much more difficult to pull off.

Still going to have the, now free, Chromecast Ultra 4k with ethernet cable power adapter afterward too. It works fine even if I don't pair Stadia controllers with it.This Ubisoft initiative to transfer licenses to PC is actually worthless to me since my PC doesn't have a GPU capable of playing games anyway and I have no intention to buy one.	lnanek2	8.692529	-4.1105795	comment	6.0	39.0	1664729712	14.416043

Being able to just go buy a pack of trees for $20 or something is a huge timer saver.- Animation re-targeting. It seems like there's a 3rd party plugin for this but it also seems like it hasn't been updated in a year. In unity I can buy a big pack of animations for pretty cheap and reuse it on almost all my humanoid characters. That's huge. I think this can be done in Blender or Maya, but it's so seamless in the engine compared to using a 3rd party tool.	overgard	8.542828	-3.942383	comment	6.0	33.0	1657829121	8.151235

I fear that we will have to push for some legal regulation if we want accurate data, and ... people will probably be opposed to that."	jrockway	7.6609955	-4.474324	comment	7.0	24.0	1609774877	-14.127551

We use both email and Slack, but most conversations tend to be asynchronous regardless and I frequently wonder why we even have an instant messenger.That said, I find that even if a message is asynchronous, it is much easier to track conversation flow via slack than email. Reply chains and indentations get messy and become an eye sore to navigate. If I write, ""Hey, did you do that thing?"" and don't hear ""Yep, it's done"" for a day, I can more easily see the flow of thought in Slack.Though, I would appreciate a more standardized practice around, ""If Slack says you are available, we can expect you to respond relatively quickly"" than seeing a green dot and not hearing back for hours or a d"	kempbellt	7.6403584	-4.445287	comment	7.0	53.0	1611420667	9.271133

Google is just cheap and won’t invest in their own platform.Direct quote:
""We were approached by the Stadia team,"" one prominent indie developer told me.

I'll make two observations.First, for AI and machine learning type workloads, the infrastructure situation is a big mess right now unless you buy into the Nvidia / CUDA ecosystem. If you're a research, you pretty much have to, but increasingly people will just want to run models that have already been trained. Fairly soon, WebGPU will be an alternative that more or less Just Works, although I do expect things to be rough in the early days. There's also a performance gap, but I can see it closing.Second, for compute shaders in general (potentially accelerating a large variety of tasks), the barrier to entry falls dramatically.

Chats go bad once too many people participate, so you split chats into channels of ~50. You can upvote messages and once they reach a threshold they will be broadcasted to all channels. Broadcasted messages can be saved in an archive and reread later by everyone.Monitization can be done by allowing people to pay for broadcasts.Everyone can start their own chatroom of course but names are unique.Please, someone do it, I want this.

Slow like in a 2 hours print becomes 12 hours print if it's colored. And it wastes a lot of plastic (and doing so does a lot of noise, too).- The printer can't print things like ASA. Limited to PLA/PETG/TPU.- While the design of the hotend and swappable nozzle looks nice at a first glance, the printer is a closed design and is not clear how well you can service it when needed. I've a Prusa MK4 and owned different Prusa Minis in the past, to print for a shop 24h, and if you want to print for production and not just for a few weeks hobby, you need to be able to fix those printers.

But this machine is pretty much a Prusa Mini with linear rails, and I'd bet there is open-source in their firmware and slicer, but there's no way to find out because their business model is to give nothing back to the ecosystem they have leveraged.

Maybe SDL_gpu can take this role once it’s finished, but till then I’m toiling away with Vulkan… yeah it’s still better than OpenGL, but its usability can definitely be improved.

And batteries go bad in a matter of years, so you need to buy a soldering iron and a LiPo cell from shady sources unless you're into replacing >$100 devices every three years or so. Or buy external AAA batteries and a wall charger like 90s toy cars.I don't mind the aesthetics of wires.

You never quite have a stable notion of ""where you are"". I don't know how else to describe it.It's worth noting that I don't feel this way about Slack (mostly). It has a clear visual hierarchy of Servers > Channels/DMs > Messages [> Threads].

The HP printers are constantly fighting me by, e.g., demanding internet access to print, failing to print when HP servers temporarily go down, putting up baffling errors, etc.  The Brother printers just work.The fact that Wirecutter recommended HP when Brother is so clearly superior has forever lowered my faith in their recommendations.	jessriedel	8.307532	-4.1268163	comment	8.0	47.0	1604454961	6.832677

Most consumer printer brands, though, are designed by computer hardware or consumer electronics companies who don’t know all that much about mechanical engineering. Meanwhile, Brother is a typewriter and sewing machine company—mechanical engineers make up the majority of their engineering competence.So, IMHO, it’s no surprise that Brother gets design elements correct like “efficient use of toner” and “self-cleaning” and “optimizing for low wear on the print head” that other printer manufacturers struggle with.(If anything, you’d fear that Brother’s software [e.g. drivers] would suck even worse than everyone else’s; but somehow, it doesn’t.

28889317	I got my first printer in high schoo	I got my first printer in high school, around 90-91. It was an HP laserjet printer, when they were first going mainstream. I loved it, it always printed well, and the toner seemed to last forever. Of course, it was B/W, but that was all I needed.Fast forward to today, I have never owned an inkjet printer. Over the past 30 years I’ve owned a total of 3 laser printers. The second was in 2005, because I wanted a scanner. The third in 2014, because I wanted network. So each one has lasted around 10 years each, and not because they broke, but because I wanted new features.I have forever told anyone asking my advice on printers to avoid inkjets. When they do, they have problems with the ink, either drying out or having to replace them all the time.I agree, inkjets should’ve died a long time ago.	jader201	8.315981	-4.102456	comment	8.0	54.0	1634403906	6.83706

  - the best aspect in my eyes is the fact that it can be installed as a single binary and runs really quickly, none of the bloat of needing complex installers and dozens of packages like Unity does
  - the language choice is also pretty interesting, their GDScript language being a bit like Python and being integrated pretty well with the engine, as well as other builds support C# and thus switching from Unity is easier (and C# is just a really nice language); there are community bindings or the ability to use C++, but i"	KronisLV	8.503298	-3.960901	comment	8.0	31.0	1646897957	8.084784

How many years will it take this team to recreate Discord?If it would take them less than 500 years, then, in some sense, Discord isn't 10 billion dollars worth of software.I think the point is that almost all of the value of Discord comes from the network effect of people locked in to using it. On the one hand, that's kind of a trivial observation, of course the users are value comes from. But, if you don't realize this, it's important to know.

Right now only the first four are supported, and the rest should be done by the end of August.Why did I create this? To solve two big problems I see with the current IM solutions: there are too many of them, and the clients are ridiculously bloated for what they are built to do. For example, everyone knows what a huge resource hog the Skype client is. Even the Telegram client, which is supposed to be lightweight, is using 1.3 GB of RAM on my desktop right now.I'm obsessed with performance. The entire application is about 4 MB, and it's never going to be more than 10 MB. In fact there are still many things to optimize.

Right now there are too many OpenGL implementations and the differences matter. Running one OpenGL library on top of N different Vulkan implementations is miles better than running on top of N different OpenGL implementations.- POSIX can be a library too. It doesn’t have to be provided by the kernel. People have been strapping POSIX layers on top of things for ages. This was originally how Mach worked. You can still do weird things on iOS and macOS “below” the POSIX layer (although most POSIX syscalls are just provided by the kernel).You talk about how hard it is to change APIs… and how much you hate to refactor things every time Google decides they w	klodolph	8.717682	-4.623709	comment	9.0	107.0	1553584180	7.8155184

What should be a Wiki?Whenever we have any of these discussions, I always feel like we’re circling around what Wave once was, and potentially could have been. It wasn’t fully polished, but so many of the fundamental concepts were there.

That's also the superiority of email over any chat solution. I don't understand why people and organizations get so excited about real-time conversations.We always had real time.

However, the situation on Windows isn't as bad as on macOS/iOS because drivers generally support Vulkan as well.Metal: This mostly exists because Apple refuses to support anything Khronos related, for not-particularly-compelling reasons.

This typically upsets another big player, so the compromise is that both changes get added to OpenGL and the users are caught in the crossfire.I think in an ideal world, Vulkan would have arrived years earlier and became the central standard that succeeded where OpenGL failed.

Personally I spray bed with a hairspray and tweak leveling screws while first layer is going on[1], that's just fine.Old Marlin ABL also has bug/tendency to report erroneous tilt towards the last corner it measures, I suspect due to Z axis missing step from microstepping. Ultimately it was too finicky for me without resorting to closed-loop drivers, which also almost completely solved the leveling problem.1: I know it is a big flat NO to touch a robotic equipment in operation, unless said robot is specifically designed to be almost completely incapable of applying any force to any parts of a human body, but I'm smart and I consider my printer a co-bot so it's okay(it's not okay.

As a result our current intention is to only support Vulkan and eventually drop support for DX11 as this shouldn't effect any of our backers. DX12 would only be considered if we found it gave us a specific and substantial advantage over Vulkan.

I don't think that you can expect both.I do agree that it is a bit wasteful but unfortunately it isn't economical for them to retrieve the partially-used cartridges from cancelled subscriptions, so it is just thrown away.

Windows downloaded the drivers and it all just worked.If your printer is well supported out of the box in CUPS you might do ok, but that does not seem to be that common if your printer is new-ish.	pseudosavant	8.376306	-4.146905	comment	10.0	52.0	1603145692	6.8243093

If you make an effort to moderate it, it can be a huge asset to productivity.Speaking of the example in the article, there is absolutely no reason clients should have direct message channels with your company's employees and expect to get a response 24/7.

Imagine my surprise when, after installing the cartridges about a year later, I learned they were the wrong “region”. Turns out HP region locks ink like they are Blu-Rays or Nintendo games!I had no idea I was buying “out-of-region” ink cartridges and I also had no idea such a thing could possibly matter. I called HP and the tech support person had the gall to tell me they have different ink for different regions because the climates are different. I nearly swallowed my teeth at the stupidity of such a claim.They offered nothing until I started telling my story on Twitter, and suddenly a Support person messaged me on Twitter offering free replacements.

Plus, it's hard to find past discussion, and it's hard to jump in after being gone for a few days (or, even a few hours).Threads are absolutely the answer. But, the defaults matter - Slack isn't encouraging threaded, long-form messages. Instead, it makes all messages feel urgent - and it makes the cost of sending a message way too cheap.I'm on a mission to bring back forums, where threading is the default. Inspired by YC's Bookface software, I'm working on a project to make forums as slick as Slack or Notion [1].

Ray tracing is already starting to be a thing in consumer products, so we're bound to get photorealism at interactive framerates in the next decade or so. No neural networks needed.There might also be a misconception that GTAV couldn't make their game more murky/realistic-looking, but more often than not, saturation and contrast is purposefully cranked up in games (particularly driving ones).

Switch to a conversation with a single animated party parrot emoji, go to another fullscreen app once again, and CPU usage never drops below a whopping 22%.

I can tell a lot of people are the same way just by their behavior; the discussion that happens on Discord is a lot different than anything on, say, HN or Reddit, and certainly Facebook or LinkedIn.People are a lot more open when they're not worried about being watched.

Over the past year, we've made great progress in improving both the keyboard and screen reading experiences in Slack. We know many users have been relying on IRC and XMPP clients for a more accessible experience — but our goal is to build all of the accessibility features you need directly into Slack.Here's a thought: how about you write a native app for each platform? I can guarantee that the hundreds, if not thousands, of engineers working on AppKit and Windows APIs are a lot better at getting this to work than your team.	saagarjha	7.644365	-4.42498	comment	12.0	305.0	1520457538	9.18502

If a given channel has too much activity and is too ""off topic"" you'll usually find like-minded people who'll just fork to a smaller, more manageable channel.

I mean, I understand the motive of making consumers buy ink more often, but from the manufacturer's point of view, why would they want to throw perfectly good ink away? Colour ink isn't as expensive to manufacture as they like to claim but it's still worth something. Why didn't they just put less ink in the cartridge to begin with (and maybe lie about how much was in it), instead of lying about how much was left toward the end of its life and throwing ink away?	captaincrowbar	8.316977	-4.0950365	comment	12.0	65.0	1504648021	6.793237

The printer we have has never had any issues, including a situation where a bunch of boba tea spilled into the printer. Hosed it down, let it dry, and still works!	blitz	8.310862	-4.1117716	comment	13.0	57.0	1684769554	6.850984

The hurdle for someone to join Discord and ask a question is much lower than signing up to a custom forum and posting there. I also love interacting with people that use my stuff. Makes me feel warm and fuzzy to see that people are actually using it.I can see the other side of course. There are a few things that are repeated questions or useful content that may benefit others. I try to push that stuff into GitHub or add it to the docs. I've also thought about recording the Discord channel and publishing that too, so that the search engines get it. I am afraid that that may scare people away though. If you feel like everything you ask (even with you pseudonym) is recorded forever, you are more afraid to ask stupid questions.	binwiederhier	7.6096234	-4.2581697	comment	13.0	77.0	1644670283	9.234213

It actually uses the CPU of your pi to improve the print, as opposed to Octoprint which basically just spits the gcode straight over to the microcontroller.Upgrading to Klipper has been the second best upgrade I've made to my Ender3, with the best being a main board with silent stepping.	tcrenshaw	8.356737	-4.042322	comment	14.0	73.0	1660445516	-9.159722

It‘s been like this for almost 2 decades.That‘s about the time I switched to laser printers. Currently I equipped myself and my family with a Brother HL 3152CDW. I got it for around 160-180€. The included toners print 1-2k pages. A new toner does 2-2,5k and costs around 60€ per color (genuine Brother) or around 50-60€ for a 4-color-toner set from noname brands. We have the printer since maybe 3-4 years and had to buy 1 black toner. I think I got a noname cartridge for around 25€.If you want a smaller device and save a little money, get a b/w laser printer for less than 100€.If I need to print photos, I go to a store with instant printing kiosks. It takes a few minutes to print dozens of photos and it‘s cheap, around 0,20	jackson1way	8.304581	-4.1084633	comment	14.0	70.0	1579336796	6.833794

You pay for printed pages. If the ink runs out, the printer automatically orders a set of new ones, for no additional cost. You receive a package to your preferred postal address, that contains the new ink and a sealable, labeled, post-stamped bag in which you will put the old ones and send it back to HP.I absolutely love this model. I pay the minimal 2USD for it (if I exceed the monthly printable 50 pages, I get another 10p/$1, or upgrade "	kmarc	8.310157	-4.1057086	comment	14.0	100.0	1579336818	6.872821

That was two years ago, we’re still on the first cartridge. The printer before that was also a monochrome laser printer and that lasted nearly a decade (only got rid of it because it didn’t support wireless and I couldn’t be bothered running cables anymore). Basically, I think monochrome lasers can last forever, they always work (even if I haven’t printed for 6 months). Most people seem to buy printers with way too many features and they need 7 ink cartridges etc. I rarely print anything, but when I do I want it to just work.	benjamoon	8.307136	-4.1043873	comment	14.0	68.0	1680438818	6.856155

When you encounter a problem to solve, there's often a process already defined that is most efficient (or at least thought to be most efficient), when accomplishing tasks, there's a pre-defined way of laying out the tasks (i.e. tickets), updating them, reviewing them, and organizationally figuring out what's best to do next.In my opinion, these processes are an attempt at organizational efficiency. However, the flip side is it reduces personal agency for the worker. There's little room to diverge or think about what you're doing.

It brings down the RRP of the printer, thereby making it look more competitive than it really is.It is a risk that users might not buy your cartridges. That is a risk these manufacturers accept when they sell their product below market value.Loading up your printer with DRM is having your cake and eating it. It is anti-competitive and ought be outlawed. Either sell the unit at the real price you want to get from it, or accept the risk that your get rich scheme might not work.

It's also nice that I can join a server, get my answer, then leave that server with no lingering email sign up for some one-off forum that I'll never visit again, and then I get bombed with emails after I'm done.

A synchronous answer should not be expected. Instead, Slack has been pushed as the replacement of email and is being used as the single place where all the discussions are going on in real-time, making it extremely difficult to work on a complex task without taking the risk of missing an important decision/discussion.I find it amazing that this tool is used unquestionably by every small/medium company without ever wonderi	bvandewalle	7.637587	-4.4595103	comment	15.0	137.0	1585207142	9.213394

I think what they did is absolutely amazing and will be seen retrospectively as one of the biggest fads of history.- They managed to disturb millions of worker to an attention-driven work culture in which everything needs to always be synchronous and immediate.- They managed to change chat from a set of open protocols to a single closed app terribly written in JS.- They managed to make a lot of people absolute convinced advocate of Slack so that a lot of hyped startups have now to use Slack de facto or risk mutiny and have people create Slack channels on behalf of the company without any oversight.So yeah I don't blame them but I blame every company that falls for this. I'm convinced that we will see Slack retrospectively as something that destroyed productivity.

App constantly breaks, doesn't load images until reset, has insane input lag(try pressing enter to send the message and start typing the next one...) and ram usage often skyrockets. I can often fetch a coffe when I switch tabs between Chats and Teams.

When my daughter got old enough to ask why don't we have a printer I said: Whenever you want to print, go to the library and I'll give you the money for printing, there is no limit. For some reason the whole family's printing budget has never exceeded 5 Euros per year in the last 20 years. Distance to the library cannot be the reason, it is 1 minute from school. I worked in a paperless company for many years, where the printer was locked to print only contracts and similar documents.While printing is overrated, of course the library printer needs a driver, too. And preferably open source in true Stallman spirit (I'm not a big Stallman fan, but wasn't it so that the whole Free Software movement started because of a closed source printer driver?).

If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don't really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don't feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the ""clique"" so they don't feel comfortable talking/discuss"	opdahl	7.6135726	-4.2320166	comment	17.0	185.0	1644669958	9.262566

If they had purchased Dropbox and Slack they could've gotten a foothold rather quickly and slowed down one of Microsoft's major selling points (you already use Office, why not Azure?). Discord could be another interesting company in the chat space, as I'm sure they are considering an enterprise play (if they aren't they are insane, considering they have one of the more user friendly chat services and with SSO and a SLA they could probably charge $10 per user).(Yes, I know Chime exists.

Unlike Slack, it targets a price-averse demographic and is attempting to enter spaces that are very saturated (Steam, Origin, Epic, Ubisoft are already crushing the digital distribution medium), so then it's basically an IRC replacement for gamers.I understand Slack's valuation as it targets huge companies with up to decades-long contracts and has projected revenues > $1B for this year, but I just don't see Discord making money the same way. I use it daily with my friends, but none of us have Nitro (although the features are pretty neat). The only way I see it moving to profitability is doing targeted ads (which will significantly hinder user experience).I see it going the way of Xfire[1].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfire	dvt	7.601724	-4.3013854	comment	19.0	203.0	1545434652	9.256199

Then saying that only retards buy the shit hedgefunds are peddling would also be considered discriminatory.

In 2020 a top consumer or business printer will not jam on you.The business printers in 2000 had slow processors and more ram.  It was significantly bad that printing PDFs spent more time processing the file than putting toner on page.Finally, the interfacing for printers today is fantastic.  I know this isn’t about toner on page, but having wifi connection, an LCD touchscreen interface, and them generally being a little smaller has made the experience better.The only thing that was better about printing in 2000 is that back then printing was more useful because so many people wanted paper copies.

If you don't print much, you can get a HP printer for $30.The cheapest Brother laser printer is $100 + ink.At $1/mo, it's going to 6 years (thanks Ansil) for the price to work out in favor of the Brother.And to the people saying brothers last forever: they don't. I've owned 3. When the drum wears out, the printer is trash because brother charges almost the cost of the printer for a replacement. That $100 brother has a drum that costs $89 and lasts for 12000 pages. So 12000 pages is the life of that printer.Edit: Re: ink drying out. HP doesn't consider printer cleaning and maintenance pages in their page count. So you can actually clean the printer regularly so the ink doesnt dry out, and they'll keep sending you new cartridges.	rgbrenner	8.295709	-4.115805	comment	20.0	105.0	1604940656	6.8637652

37782477	Even if you only print things once a	Even if you only print things once a month, a laser printer is far less wasteful in time, money, and bullshit than ink that's perpetually dry or consumed.Rather than an entry-level laser printer that cannot be economically repaired, a used mid-level enterprise printer is often the cheapest option long term and saves useful electronics from becoming e-waste. Office furniture rental/repo places and secondary markets like eBay have these.In large enterprises, a printer's cost per page tends to be inversely proportional to (increased) initial acquisition cost and availability of repair parts. Put another way, giving everyone an entry-level printer would be far more expensive in acquisition costs, per-page costs, and an inability to repair them. (hitting TCO 3 ways).I had a HP LaserJet 4 (relea	sacnoradhq	8.314862	-4.099157	comment	22.0	133.0	1696531723	6.8341117

Now it does it's one thing slightly less well. The first of many casualties, no doubt.It makes me despair of business models which require growth to be chased at all costs.

None of the games are ones that I care about.It feels like they could have—at the cost of short-term profit and pride—partnered with Valve and shipped something mind-blowing. But instead we're left with a bunch of AAA games that feel half-baked (Hitman crashes on first boot and complains about a lack of a controller) and a bunch of indie games that feel like a sad attempt to squeeze a few extra bucks out of a middling title (the Hello Neighbor hide and seek game) and titles released half a decade ago (superhot).Minecraft is on every console imaginable—except Stadia.

But there are times when I have no choice. A few years back, a group of interns started privately harassing other interns via Slack. Only way to see it was to boot an offending intern from his work station and go into his Slack to see what was happening. We had to make all intern accounts into multi-channel guests after that. Compare that to our email, where I can go into anyone's messages immediately if need-be. This is all very standard corporate IT stuff that you need for HR and legal reasons.Edit: I'll say this is still not an ideal solution.

I've been using IRC for years and I still love it but with recent adoption of Slack it seems everyone wants to push all the communication there and I don't think it works. It's hard to search for stuff (usually it takes me 3-4 queries to find thing _I know_ is there) and then it's in lengthy conversational format that takes a bit of time to replay. You might lose window of opportunity to provide important info just because you aren't present at the moment and since Slack is perceived as a low impact tool, those conversations can happen in late evening 	xlii	7.639026	-4.39816	comment	26.0	172.0	1631793074	4.5560365

26550678	What's interesting about acquisition	What's interesting about acquisitions like this is that the actual value that is being transacted is the userbase and their data, along with the inability for either of those to easily move elsewhere.No one wants to buy the actual chat application itself, because they could build equivalent technology on their own. But users are locked into platforms so heavily and for such long time periods that they themselves give the platform almost the entirety of its value (not to single out Discord, since we all know this is how a lot of acquisitions work in practice). [As an additional caveat, I will add that Discord has definitely built something that its users love, and I don't want to undermine the absurd amount of UI, feature refinement, and scaling work they've done successfully.

You had to buy games at real $40-$60 prices but you could only play them through this limited service. I don't think anyone wants that.Compare that to paying the same price for a regular PC game which you can play via streaming using a streaming service, but also play locally, and know that you can take that game with you through multiple hardware decides and streaming services.With Stadia, if I move somewhere with bad internet, there is no way to recover the value of my games I purchased. There is no other gaming system like that. All other systems either have an offline possibility or are pure streaming where	lbwtaylor	8.722666	-4.0784907	comment	27.0	322.0	1664678187	14.417909

There’s so many communities that end up moving to it because it serves their most engaged members so well, but it’s terrible for everyone else.For example, “Voron” 3D printers are an awesome open-source design, but more and more I am directed to their discord to ask questions - many of which were, in all likelihood, asked dozens of times before. It’s great for their engaged members, who are all super helpful - but if it’s a reddit thread I can get my answer almost immediately, rather than asking, waiting and consuming someone else’s time for trivialities.Sites like reddit at least can	Panzer04	7.603926	-4.216498	comment	28.0	238.0	1678159303	9.228343

It's a chat room.  With channels.  So, sorry to tell you guys, but it's not innovative, it's lucky.  We had chat rooms back in 1995.  Yes, that scrappy startup Microsoft will not have too much trouble implementing a chat room and they don't need luck to get users.  How were the people at Slack not thinking ""Holy shit, people are paying for this!"" the entire time like it was a dream.  I'm sure Slack will continue with much success now that they have their user base, so good for them, but to delude themselves into thinking no one can do it as good as they do is a bit naive."
