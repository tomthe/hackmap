For some reason not elucidated, nobody seems to be using it for industrial process heat, e.g. making cement.		ncmncm

The oil fills vast volume under the ground.Solar panels may take up more surface area, but the energy output per unit of material and volume should easily out-class oil.There is also no shortage of area on land or sea that is otherwise useless to us.		gibolt
