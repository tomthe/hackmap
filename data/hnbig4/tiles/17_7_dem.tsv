33326652	For the past 3 years I’ve worked in 	For the past 3 years I’ve worked in an almost 100% pair programming environment. It works wonders for a lot of problems, especially around “code ownership”. It’s much harder to get precious with your code, or point fingers at someone else’s code, when the responsibility for every line is shared by at least two people.But I found that the pressure of pairing shuts down a lot of thought. Long silences are forbidden in pairing; you must vocalize your thought process. I found myself searching for gaps in the conversation where I could think for a second and blurt out my thoughts before it’s too late to turn the train around. I believe pairing can lead to local maxima this way because there’s no room in the conversation for deep thought.	et1337	13.880517	-0.136843	comment	3.0	11.0	1666676391	-13.180205

There are studies justifying the cost by showing it can be recovered with less testing, code review, and bug hunting. But that evidently hasn't been persuasive. Also, anyone familiar with statistical quality control (SQC or SQA) would look at pair programming and see 100% inspection. Very suboptimal in manufacturing.Still, pair programming makes sense in the abstract: Coding is not manufacturing. Applying SQC to code is nonsensical. Under the circumstances, 100% inspection is all you've got. Pair programming probably makes sense in cases where minimizing bugs at every step, right down to the creation of every line of code, is needed because the cost of a bug explodes the l	Zigurd	13.877395	-0.13524184	comment	3.0	13.0	1699886516	-13.193496

When I use metamask to buy something on the chain, it'll ask me to confirm if that's ok or not. That's all that the developer of the page can do, they can ask metamask to confirm the transaction is safe. Once it's confirmed, a one-time unique token for the transaction is created, and used to execute the transaction. This can work because the browser provides the secure separation between app and wallet. Otherwise, no one would trust a 3rd party to run transactions for them on the blockchain.	felipellrocha	13.624833	0.5992359	comment	3.0	10.0	1667598351	-11.63442

However, it doesn’t make sense when one entity controls the entire system because if a hacker (or even an insider) can change one record, they could change all of them. Hence why a good blockchain would be distributed. Then, if one node edits the history, the other nodes will see the anomaly and ignore that node.This is also why Git’s history is easy to edit when it’s only on your machine.

It seems too good to be true, if it works it's much better (faster, free) than block chain cryptocurrencies with no downsides. I am surprised that no one else has come up with this approach so far, why is that?The only downside it's not currently decentralized, and requires a ""conductor"" to run securely, which will be removed in the future, apparently. The other criticisms are at the first implementation (rolling own crypto), which is an error that impacts confidence in the team but not the currency / concept."	albertgoeswoof	13.871594	0.991711	comment	3.0	11.0	1512559457	-11.260747

Then another user picks it with another one and send his. And so on and so forth. But who gets to decide which tree to follow?This is exactly what mining is for: It is election based on mining capacity (or hash rate burn rate). The one who burns more hash rate gets elected to publish the next blockchain.Not that mining can't get centralized, it is. But there is a difference: Mining is democratic.

But with relatively little effort you can add that to git, making a blockchain out of it.What blockchains do in cryptocurrencies is not magic: they're just the basic auditing mechanism that allows everyone with a full node to verify that all the rules are being followed by parsing all the transactions. The simplest way to do that is with a linear chain of blocks that you validate, starting at block zero.All the ""magic"" is in the consensus mechanisms that decide which chain of blocks is in fact the real chain, not the blockchains themselves."	petertodd	13.86399	1.0252262	comment	3.0	10.0	1527095682	10.435556

Web3 runs on different rails than Web2.Web3 typically runs on IPFS which is like an upgraded HTTPS where instead of just one computer hosting a file on the internet it's instead lots of different people around the world. It's pretty much impossible to censor a file on IPFS. IPFS also allows easy offline web apps and a built-in CDN.Web3 also uses a decentralized execution and state system where instead of your data being in one companies' servers like Facebook it's instead hosted on thousands of people's copy of the database. The important state data is impossible to censor.In Web3 the infrastructure is distributed and no one controls it. You can run an app without having to trust anyone.

There aren't many cryptographers who work in both theory and application the way Aumasson does. He recently wrote Serious Cryptography and has done professional cryptanalysis since 2012. He is also a co- or primary author for several cryptographic algorithms; including BLAKE/BLAKE2, NORX, SipHash, and Gravity SPHINCS.In the course of establishing his argument he groups cryptographic vulnerabilities into four main categories.

Without that, the exercise is futile.IMO - pair programming is over-hyped. I often find that I produce better, more reliable code, with the more space and more time I am given.

29685239	As I understand it, the gist of web3	As I understand it, the gist of web3 is to do away with the need for having centralized organizations who control a particular resource. For example domain names, identities, speech. In the beginning, the web was supposed to be an egalitarian and democratic space. Of course corporations and governments seized as much control as they could. Today we have companies that dictate arbitrary rules. For example, there is nothing you can do to grow your Twitter account. If Youtube decides they don't like you anymore, your audience is gone. Your domain name is not really yours, etc.Supposedly web 3.0 would fix this problem by making sure decision power is decentralized. Will it deliver?

There's also knock on benefits down the road as IMO with pairing / mobbing there's less of a tendency to miss edge cases and so you're less likely to have bugs that need to be revisted, which is an enormous cost savings.	ryanbrunner	13.859177	-0.13988572	comment	3.0	12.0	1645180265	-13.190576

Two programmers working on the same project at the same time is already slower than one programmer working twice as long because these two have to communicate. And during pair programming, the communication is sped up.In my experience, pair programming is really fun and helpful for some parts of my work, for example brainstorming solution ideas or finding bugs.	tweakimp	13.879142	-0.13752684	comment	3.0	12.0	1645185977	-13.185888

Some techs need hardware to catch up to be cheap enough, and only after a few failed attempts they manage to grow a trend... and it will probably will last until it's used to finance a proper starting of WW3 and by then banning it will be too late.Anyway, we'll enjoy the hell out of ourselves on the new patreons-but-for-snuff-p03n, so it will all have been worth it :)	nnq	13.66799	0.5951087	comment	3.0	11.0	1656011714	-11.706026

It's an identity. It's a brand. It's a community. If I was in my 30's I'd probably be into it. I would know damn well there was a lot of hype, but so what, it's fun and maybe something amazing will come out of it. Meantime, it's a party, and we can all take turns at the mic making deep pronouncements about how we're empowering the forgotten poor of the world. What's not to like? Who cares if we lose money.

Trying to do it professionally with neither diplomas feels like a non-starter to me.Of course, that doesn't mean you can't study the field on your own for the sake of knowledge. And it will certainly make you a better infosec professionnal, whatever subfield you want to specialize in.Also, keep in mind there are maybe 1000 people working in information security for 1 person working as a professional cryptographer.

Sometimes I flirt with the idea of making this community a decentralized autonomous web3 community. Currently I am the sole arbiter and mediator when there is conflict. I would love to shift this responsibility to a random selection of active members that have enrolled for this role for a certain time period. I envision a rotating council formulates the complaint, and a selected group votes on a set predefined outcomes. Members pay a virtual crypto currency and when problems arise this fund can be used to pay for insurance claims. Still very much in its infancy but I could see a good use case for web3 here.

When someone is trying to sell you a currency, they're not trying to sell you a product. They're trying to get you to inflate the value of it so the miners can realize their profits, while you get stuck holding the tokens that will then change value randomly. And even if there were any merit to any of the claims made by web3 companies (there isn't), by definition most of these web3 projects/startups would fail and collapse to nothing anyway, making the token worthless, and losing everything the holders have.Payments for IPFS storage isn't a horrible idea, but it needs to be done in a normal way using real money, without the speculative tokens.	hnthrow1010	13.67864	0.67819834	comment	3.0	11.0	1657726555	-11.61894

The vast majority of people just care that they can read articles, watch videos, do shopping, etc...Web3 makes these tasks more complex and slower in order to create a decentralised, privacy-preserving, cryptocurrency supporting network. No average user cares about privacy on the web or paying with anything other than fiat.And if the user base isn't there, what company will build software to interact with Web3?

The term imagines the transition of many internet services to a model built around cryptographic tokens, such that ownership and/or control of those services might be divided between their token-holders, a group that might include their users. The tokens would also have exchange value, so, as a user, you could always: cash out.Except in 99% of cases there is no technical reason for those tokens to exist. Everything they claim to do can be done with Bitcoin by itself.Look, there's nothing wrong with harvesting money from digital rubes.

Other people also wanted to get rich, but that exact opportunity feels like it passed (still holding out for my $80 invested in Bitcoin to be worth >$100,000, but I got in kind of late), so people started making their own coins in the hopes of repeating the process.  That had mixed success, Etherium (and maybe Dogecoin) did pretty well, but most didn't.  The SEC even started cracking down on ICOs.So, there is a legitimate need for some new business model where you print money and keep most of it for yourself.  Web3!

Yes, you’re right that in many cases you have to rely on an external oracle, so a protocol can’t be fully “trustless”.However the difference is that we can abstract away the oracle from the rest of the value transfer mechanism.For example if we want to bet on the winner of the Super Bowl, in the old days we’d have to find a trusted third party to hold the money for us. Essentially a bookie. Finding a trusted bookie, especially one who’s licensed in multiple jurisdictions is really hard.In contrast, we can probably find a trusted “oracle” for the Super Bowl much easier. For example AP is extremely trustworthy (largely because they’re not in the legally dodgy business of sports betting).

I built Graphite, a popular dApp, using traditional Web3 auth and I just recently cracked 10K users after 2 years...The status quo today expects users to navigate pop-ups, install extensions, and of course manage their 12-word key phrase! What I've learned is that people don't really care about decentralization. They should, but they don't — at least not yet. What people do care about is protecting their data privacy and convenience.Therefore, we built SimpleID, a suite of developer tools that lets you easily on-board users to Web3 apps. If your users are tech-savvy and want a 100% truly decentralized solution, you're probably not going 	jhunter1016	13.637856	0.5721941	comment	3.0	12.0	1568216803	-11.647384

For an even more limited set of applications, we can also enforce invariants while preserving the confidentiality of transactions.With hindsight, the two technological breakthroughs that proved decentralized databases possible were Bitcoin and Zerocash.

Someone coined this termed and released a bunch of press releases to get it to catch on. I don't even know why people are giving it the time of day. It's someone's marketing speak and it smells awful.And furthermore, decentralization is not new nor is it unique to the web, nor does this ""web 3"" garbage have anything to do with the web either.

I'm happy to walk people through a prototype afterwards and discuss it and if necessary throw the thing away and start over or significant revise it. I'm not happy to have someone disrupt my thinking about a problem while I'm trying to focus.Fundamentally I tend to think that people who insist pairing is ok to impose on people think everyone is like them, and don't see that it's forcing out people with different ways of thinking and processing problems.

When it was purchased by Microsoft and people started looking elsewhere, they looked to competing centralized solutions like GitLab and Bitbucket.Given that centralization is so useful, and people want it so much, it should not be resisted.

This perspective confuses me, because it doesn't seem to be a particularly meaningful distinction when there is still one consensus truth in the network.In the case of a naming system, as you point out, that means there is still one finite, scarce namespace in the system, just as there is in DNS.More generally, there is still a central authority pushing out code, and so unless you want to hard-fork, what does the ""decentralization"" in a blockchain actually buy you?

The only primitives that I feel safe playing with are: SHA2, AES, PBKDF2, CSPRNG, and Microsoft's DPAPI (for secret management). I always use first party implementations where possible. In this case, all of my crypto primitives are entirely written by Microsoft.I never really screw with asymmetric crypto primitives directly. The closest I'll get to that area is stuff like loading a PFX byte array into an AspNetCore webapp for presenting a TLS cert.	bob1029	13.587607	1.0026946	comment	4.0	12.0	1598777533	-3.3568192

If you sell a domain on ethereum (ENS), the escrow requires only a smart contract and fees scale with the network so like $50 right now. I'm working on connecting the two.Intermediaries are a huge reason the web is the way it is. If we can eliminate them, the internet looks very different. My biggest prediction is that fundamental protocols like TLS will altered to integrate with blockchain protocols.Web3 isn't just a scam or waste of resources. It will enable us to do things we already do but much cheaper than we do them now. Lots of smart people are flooding into the space. It will take at least a decade but it's already happening.	dumbfoundded	13.7029505	0.60587025	comment	5.0	24.0	1639514156	-11.649516

Blockchain is a decentralised ideal, but so is BitTorrent, so is Tor, and so on, to some significant extent. To say that decentralisation failed because blockchain failed ignores all the other technologies which are serving people well.I think the distinction between “decentralised” (i.e. federated) and “distributed” is important (as decentralised is often used as an umbrella term to cover both).[0] There are tons of federated projects out there from Matrix to Mastodon, and there are initiatives to make federated networks more decentralised (such as the integration of Kademlia DHT in BitTorrent).No need for pessimism I think. :)[0]: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Hoelscher/publica	boramalper	13.574764	1.0716795	comment	5.0	47.0	1546374241	-1.9272176

Then the operation couldn't be parallelized to a botnet as all PoWs would be unique to a CPU.It seems that they're targeting memory as a way to make it more costly for botnets. I think that there are many other ways to help minimize this attack scenario, too. The same logic could also be applied to mobile phones using ESIM.

Many people were happy to be exposed to it, but many weren’t. Of those, some were better for the experience, some weren’t. In either case, it was massively disrespectful of me to force it on people. Certain kinds of people are drawn to programming. Asking some of those people to pair all day every day is tantamount to asking them to switch careers. I for one don’t have the emotional energy for it any more. Having said all that, I would encourage any skeptics to give it a try, in the right environment with the right teammates.

Right now, if there's a bug in feature x, everyone goes to the feature x ""guy"" to have it fixed. If that person gets hit by a bus, feature x is hosed.

Peter Thiel is an unlikeable human for many reasons, but let's not forget that Gawker also outed him as gay without his permission. WaPo skips over that too.It sounds like the outcome of Hogan v. Gawker is that news media - and especially the ream of online-only ""news"" sites that have sprouted over the past decade - are far more likely to fact check their stories before they publish stories that only serve to humi"	jgacook	13.858251	0.14892562	comment	6.0	87.0	1501464720	14.181121

Hulk Hogan is entirely moot to the issue at hand.Hogan's case was just a vehicle for Thiel's goal of getting back at a company who had written articles that he disliked. What Thiel did was to tell people with deep enough pockets to see that it's possible to destroy someone for writing articles that they disagree with. The case was structured to ensure that Gawker could not rely on insurance for paying certain damages and that people became personally liable for the damages arising from the case[1].So, imagine that Warren Buffet dislikes an expose in the Chicago Tribune about him.

It is an existential struggle. Those in favour of web3 have a vested interest now and don't want to see the value of their coins and tokens fall, while those against web3 don't want to see the last vestiges of the free and open web as we know it destroyed by the tokenisation and monetisation of every interaction.	astoor	13.698983	0.6025215	comment	6.0	26.0	1639756226	-11.640341

For example, nobody in the economics profession would refer to the financial system as being 'centralised'.  It is not.  There's no central planner.  Financial institutions are autonomous and make their own decisions with regards to what products to sell, and how to make them.

  * ease of management
  * lower overhead in task delegation
  * maintenance simplicity
  * versioning
  * no distribution

Centralization cons:  * fixed resources
  * fixed configuration
  * fixed environment

Looking at these lists centralization at first appears immediately superior.  These lists is an illusion in that it accounts for concerns in the present, but it does not account for growth or future concerns.  Decentralized systems can scale in ways centralized systems cannot.The fixed nature of a centralized system is also a huge limitation.

Then, to understand the need of programmability (smart contracts). Other pieces too: more efficient consensus mechanisms and clever ways to express commitments, decentralized storage, etc. And the space is so far from being done.Particulary, about servers being clients.

If you can not work alone without supervision you have to deal with those psychological issues first or just change your job.Your boss is not going to pay two salaries for doing the work of one. If you do pair programming, it will be because you can be more productive that way that working alone, and that is not the case most of the time (although most people want to believe that).As entrepreneur and engineer and programmer for a long time when I hear ""pair programming"", a big light bulb appears in my head screaming and blinking SCAM!.

But, on the assumption that a lot of people will just read the headline and comments I'm going to preemptively talk about the question there ...People misunderstand decentralisation in practice. Computer types, when they talk about decentralisation, usually mean a relatively large number of homogeneous nodes acting as peers. Which is cool but not how decentralised systems work in practice out in the meaty reality we all live in.In reality, we have an economy that quickly works out who is the best (say, Samuel is the best) at something (say, mining bitcoin) and routes most of the resources available for hashing to Samuel.

The natural response upon reading, ""You just have to know X"" if you don't already know is to go search for X.  Well, if you go search for ""carry propagation bug"" you will find lots of examples of carry propagation bugs being found and fixed, but no explanation of what one is.  The thing that ""you just have to know"" is not so easy to find.  The courteous thing to do when mentioning something that ""you just have to know"" but which is not easy to find is to provide a pointer or a short in-line explanation.  When you don't do that you leave your reader with no choice but to publicly expose their ignorance of this purportedly crucial knowledge by asking, which I will"	lisper	13.545863	1.074712	comment	11.0	103.0	1501776902	-2.7055027

The codebase that this node runs is proprietary software. They claim there will be no need for this masternode in the long run but they never say any ETA about when to remove it (which hints that removing it may always expose the security flaws of their network). This means it's Proof of Authority instead of Proof of Work, therefore, not decentralized.* It's 100% premined, which smells as scammy as Ripple.

But instead of a tool for decentralizing power it's becoming a tool for centralized power to wield control, to enforce conformity in ever greater detail.What would a tool of actual decentralization look like? It wouldn't be something that helps us communicate or brings us closer together, because those things evolve into instruments of control. It would be something that divides us into separate ecological and memetic niches.

Decentralization exists when a small enough community can be self-policing and actors have noble goals. That all changes when you get a single bad actor who takes advantage off their weaknesses and well-meaning nature and controls the new system (see Mancur Olson's 1993 article on roving bandits). Or look at Gilded Age America or numerous political leaders who have consolidated power out of chaos, or the Bitcoin mining system which is controlled by a very small set of miners.This is even worse in the blockchain system becau	aaron-lebo	13.528947	1.0171264	comment	12.0	53.0	1479740517	-1.4707712

Furthermore if I was someone holding solutions to cherry-picked primes for well-understood algorithms in wide use, I'd be complaining loudly every time someone wrote a bespoke library too. I'd be paying to publish books that recommend no one write their own crypto because it's just such a darned hard problem, especially with so many high quality alternatives out there tested	clord	13.570688	0.97297305	comment	15.0	182.0	1481953680	-3.276962

Sure this one place may not be controlled by a single entity, but it facilitates tracking at an unprecedented level.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate example of this and are an absolute boon to tax collectors, forensic accountants and fraudsters. In our current economy financial transactions are recorded in millions of individual ledgers that are kept private, or in the case of cash transactions are often not recorded at all, or are not linked to an individual. There is no central ledger.With crypto currencies however you can not only see all transactions but also trace them back to individual users as long as you can link a wallet to a person.

It was actually less of seismic shock than mobile first which despite being a bigger shift didn't actually get a number.As far as I'm concerned, Web3 is beyond this. It's what happen when you let Ponzi schemers write the marketing material. I can't for the life of me discern what's of actual value from what is a fabrication in the pile of technologies put forward. It doesn't help that I personally have yet to see a use for a blockchain which isn't replicating an existing financial instrument while trying to avoid the eyes of the state.I’m sure there is some good things in the middle of it all but I respect the authors of this	WastingMyTime89	13.697611	0.6064177	comment	17.0	154.0	1637710947	-11.639594
