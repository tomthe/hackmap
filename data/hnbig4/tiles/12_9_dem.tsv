And have been largely ignoring this until it seemed more certain.Can someone ELI5 why this matters? What does it enable technologically?Flying cars? Fusion reactors? Magic fix for global warming?		softwaredoug

I thought the main advantage of high-temp superconductors was using liquid nitrogen instead of helium.		cultus
