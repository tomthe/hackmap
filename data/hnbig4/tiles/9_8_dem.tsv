A good manager facilitates these items. A bad manager just throws tickets on a Kanban board.Sure, if you have a team that can do all the above without sprints, that's great. But I bet they have some other method or social structure that makes team management effective. Most software teams do not have that without some type of formalized structure, especially when new devs rotate into the team.So, I say stop criticizing the concept of a sprint and start holding your manager accountable for proper communication, effective knowledge sharing and realistic issue tracking.

It's well-accepted that owners of private property can make it available to the general public, with whatever restrictions they please. There is no good reason to treat web servers differently than store fronts.

It didn't require any sleuthing – you just had to log into LinkedIn and you could see for yourself.The reason they implemented it that way is because Google did not yet provide APIs to facilitate contact import. As Google adopted more secure standards like OAuth, LinkedIn started using the official GMail API features like ""import contacts,"" rather than logging into your account on your behalf.People underestimate just how far privacy/security have come since 2013 (pre-Snowden), when even major websites still used HTTP on their payment portals.

And this kind of process directly contributes to a culture where people are pressured based on how they work at an extremely finely grained level. Even if somebody is doing top-notch work and having real impact long-term, if they're not making legible progress day-to-day, Agile is going to make them look bad and feel bad. The process itself emphasizes consistency and incremental work while deemphasizing individual flexibility and agency.Now, perhaps some teams have a culture that's strong and accepting enough to compensate for this and provide a "	tikhonj	4.391369	1.267894	comment	3.0	13.0	1619480217	0.40319163

In agile, testing either (a) relies heavily on automation or (b) only tests that particular story. In highly complex systems that's often not sufficient and rarely do security teams for example involve themselves on a per story basis.Personally I think the industry as a whole needs to sit back and realise that Agile wasn't the panacea it was made out to be.	threeseed	4.3918347	1.2643646	comment	3.0	10.0	1515624958	-13.741925

It promises developers a larger voice, but in my experience, it heavily favors management and product management types, since they are usually the ones in control of the ticketing/tracking systems. They aren't under the sprint deadlines that developers are, so they are able to better organize and build their cases for what gets done. Even if developers can build a case, it often gets sent to the bottom of the backlog. Developers are forced to take on technical debt due to the short-term product oriented thinking. Is this because of the design of agile, or just the misapplication? Considering it's a cargo-cult management technique, I think it is part of the design.2 week sprint deadlines are entirely too short. say there's a larger projec	gnarcoregrizz	4.401484	1.2634962	comment	3.0	10.0	1524159885	-13.801313

She or he is responsible for the backlog but if she has trust in the engineers she can let the engineers add their own things to it.I think OP just works in a  bad place.	evfanknitram	4.386769	1.2652012	comment	3.0	28.0	1524334792	10.870321

Scrum has a brief window of utility if a team isn't delivering at all, and has lost management trust.  It also has a large window of dis-utility where everyone haggles over points, shows velocity as results, and leaves customers and businesses wondering what their engineers are doing.  Trust your engineers to do the right thing on their own and they might just surprise you.	lumost	4.3726773	1.2771289	comment	3.0	11.0	1524335866	10.911893

This was shortly after a teammate of mine described the three-to-four-hour biweekly sprint planning meetings he was subjected to on a previous team.Here's a tip: calculate the cost of every meeting by taking your salary (or an estimate of the average salary in the room), dividing by 52 and then again by 40, doubling it, and multiplying by the number of people and then again by the number of hours in the meeting. Alternatively, nevermind the salary calculations: subjecting 13 people to a 3 hour meeting wastes roughly a full-time human-week of productivity.	philwelch	4.401788	1.2637454	comment	3.0	11.0	1525987216	1.9606463

At its core, it’s a specific work-management method tied to the iron triangle (constrained cost, scope, and time), which requires a set plan from the start.This iterative method breaks the iron triangle. If the iron triangle is broken, is it a “project”?I feel that project-management industry is diluting the meaning of “project” to encompass other kinds of work management that aren’t “project”. End result is we’re really confusing things.

21306358	My current employer switched from SC	My current employer switched from SCRUM to KANBAN.  We're broken up into person squads. Epics are created by product by engineers are involved in kickoff and story breakdown.We use KANBAN cycle times to estimate delivery dates.  For example, my squad completes 85% of stories in 5 days. Given that, the number of stories in the epic, and number of engineers, it's easy math to calculate an approximate completion date.It's important to note that we've convinced management that these are approximate completion dates, not deadlines. The dates are used for planning upcoming features and which squad will be free first to take it on.  However, there's still plenty of adaptability.Of all the places I've worked, this model is one that I've found to be the most productive.

21419999	There's a very good reason why story	There's a very good reason why story points in scrum do not directly relate to time worked. You guess story points only in relation to each other. Over time, you can see how many story points you finish per sprint. By seeing how many story points are still on the backlog, you can estimate how long it will take. Add one or two sprints for unforeseen problems, and there's your estimate. Not based on anyone's guess, but on the time it takes to do actual work.This, in short, is the core of value that Scrum adds to the ideas of Agile.The only problem is that people insist on misunderstanding these simple ideas and try to do Scrum as wrong as possible. The problem isn't Scrum, the problem is people insisting on doing it wrong.	mcv	4.409514	1.2547723	comment	3.0	13.0	1572623040	-13.7119665

I checked it on a whim about a year ago and found an old message from someone I hadn't talked to in over 7 years, very professional message just trying to catch up. I have no other social media accounts and am not easily found through general searches, so it was the only way this person could reach me.I felt horrible for weeks that I had never responded, then I sent off a reply. I then promptly forgot that I did so, and abandoned LinkedIn for another year. I checked again last week for some reason and I had a year-old response to my response.

It shows up in the search results alright, some day I should find a UA changer to spoof Google and see if they do IP checking or just UA header checking, but generally, they made it completely locked-in now, whereas it was semi-open (at least to view) before. It was a user-configurable setting whether your profile could be viewed by people who are not signed in, and now it's just a completely walled garden.	lucb1e	4.907268	1.8862594	comment	3.0	10.0	1528059944	-4.5122437

The motivation of this proposal seems to be that we can know in advance what the impact of a new piece of technology is, and therefore we can just avoid ever developing the bad stuff, so we won't have to deal with the hard work of changing it later.But, we cannot, and it's dangerous to think we ca"	rossdavidh	4.3855	1.2678651	comment	3.0	13.0	1533332236	-13.761628

The team I'm currently on probably does not need any sort of formal Agile workflow at all besides setting our current sprint's worth of stories at the beginning of each sprint. But, that's because everyone on the team is very self-motivated and even remotely we're still very close with one another.I've been on other teams where, without standup, people would go for days without working on or talking to anyone.I think, if anything, this is proof	carterklein13	4.4255495	1.261639	comment	3.0	18.0	1600975123	12.220486

38656411	Lift and shift is a cloud migration 	Lift and shift is a cloud migration strategy which involves moving your applications to the cloud with little to no modification. For example, you have an application running on a server in your data-centre, you then deploy a VM in the cloud with a similar spec and install the application.It's usually done to avoid the engineering cost of making the services more cloud native. What tends to happen a lot is that after a considerable portion of the migration is completed, the cost of the lift-and-shift effort start to overtake the savings, and the projected costs, dwarf the future savings.I suspect this is what happened with Linkedin.	vergessenmir	4.9041915	1.8893656	comment	3.0	32.0	1702661670	-4.500689

The fact that they have a title of ""VP operations"" 2 years after graduating does not magically make them experienced. What do they do then? They read books about ""how to lead a team"", and they blindly apply what they find there.Because they have no clue. Many times they have not even had a team lead in there professional career themselves: they jumped right into management. And of course their team of junior developers (with high titles that don't make them experienced either) don't know better. So it ends up in a big cargo cult.

Whenever I read these criticisms, a lot of it rings true, but I fail to understand what the alternatives looks like besides Waterfall or chaos.

We all discuss and agree on that based on whatever overhead we can’t eliminate.Then each engineer does their best to “call their shot” every week and say how much work they’ll finish.

Is our understanding of the customer (or whatever system we are trying to improve) correct or are we basing our decisions on the wrong assumptions? If so, what do we need to learn?3.

I updated instructions, so anyone with no LinkedIn profile can email me directly with some other proof of their online presence.Originally, I got a lot of spam requests from throwaway emails that I could not validate.People who get the book this way also get access to updates: which will be fixes, corrections, and additional content.	gregdoesit	4.915009	1.8870729	comment	3.0	13.0	1602697299	-4.4470534

But if those are big enough to need their own work I can't divide further to keep myself organized. It assumes that whoever created the ticket knows roughly how much work it is or you need to go back and negotiate the structure, and ruin a bunch of links.For me personally I want to track things that need to be done, not ""week sized"" bits of work or whatever your team is calling ""agile""."	kevincox	4.403967	1.2585166	comment	3.0	15.0	1634319929	-13.415067

Despite my good feelings about it, I also see how often it’s used as a) an excuse to micromanage and b) a mechanism to feed leadership’s need for attention. I don’t know if this is accurate or not, but I’m inclined to think people that get into managerial positions are more social and that seems to come with an intrinsic need to be seen, recognized, and given some form of public accolades (like everyone laughing at thier funny jokes).

Even if you complete all the cards without carryover or other issues, the product isn't necessarily shippable. So in practice you some form of release planning, often quarterly to align with the business, that gets overlaid.The big insight with ShapeUp for me, was that is really is more a change in how to approach Release planning, than sprint/iteration process. You really can ship an end-to-end feature for a wide variety of software products in a 6 week timeframe, and it is short enough to give a lean focus, outcome oriented on delivery rather than just shipping a code increment.

I believe the angst against agile is it doesn't have a definitive viewpoint but is a reaction against what it sees as the evils of waterfall.  Without definite processes, we get scrum.From my viewpoint, the issue is that scrum has a flawed understanding of Toyota Kaizen which it based itself on.  Yes, in a Toyota factory, team members are expected to be able to perform any tasks required on the assembly line.  But, the architecture Toyota uses, to enable this agility is limiting. For example, Toyota's TNGA architecture says there will only be five modular platforms to choose from; instead of the 100+ choices in the past [1].  Furthermore, Toyota is known for ""boring"" but reliable cars.  It avoids all bleeding edge technology and prefers to "	rawgabbit	4.3873367	1.2674966	comment	3.0	12.0	1638824794	-13.758312

The point you raised about reputation is a good one: it's not just reputation in itself but also a certain culture and way of thinking that is unofficially enforced.Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the usefulness of it but I can feel something dying inside of me each time I use it as well.

The actual tech risk is very low (e.g. ruby on rails on postgres) since most of them use mature technology. In this case the agile manifesto make sense - I.e. we can build something really fast and literally ask the customer if this is what he wants every two weeks.When you building hard tech products (e.g. borg or tensorflow), the actual risk is technology and competition, and since this is new technology, there are not that many customers.

Some might even call this common sense.Most people who are pessimistic about the agile development who I have spoken to are usually pessimistic because of poor implementations they've encountered.

They have very little to do if they aren't split between multiple teams and instead try to come up with weird ways to add value which usually don't add any value. We had agile coaches at my company recently and it was one of the more painful experiences of my career. They would try to add all these different flavors of grooming, planning, standup, and retro that usually just led to developers being uncomfortable and wanting to work from home. I'm not saying agile doesn't work, but it doesn't need to be a full time job and take up that much of developers time and they sure as hell don't need to inflate the process and methodology just to feel better about themselves.	notus	4.3846264	1.2669575	comment	3.0	12.0	1566566809	-13.75414

We had a conversation the other day in which I was given to understand that if we thought some documentation was finished, but had to go back and make a tweak with no more than 15 minutes spent on it, we should be creating a ticket in Jira to do so. I'm currently cursing all the people who've sold agile because this is insanity (imo).

Since everyone knows that waterfall is a fiction that doesn't work, my opinion is correct.Developing a plan is not waterfall. Designing an Architecture is not waterfall. Agile is about adapting to change as it occurs - how do you know if there is any change if you didn't start with a plan?Good plans and designs account for risks and unknowns and anticipate (certain types) of changes and delay locking into assumptions until necessary. But not having a plan or design is not agile - it's failure."	jcstauffer	4.384746	1.2701696	comment	3.0	15.0	1597947296	-13.764789

For instance I worked on one project with two week sprints where it took a 2-3 day batch job to generate a database/a.i. model.  This had a bit of Gannt chart character in that it had to be managed in terms of calendar time instead of punchclock time.  If you didn't start the database build early enough you would predictably blow the sprint.At the same place there were a few different teams with their own sprint schedules and the system was able to turn a 1 day delay into a 4 week delay as on	PaulHoule	4.4045167	1.2611341	comment	4.0	19.0	1664975053	-13.720942

Probably the best way to appreciate Scrum is to have worked on a commercial software product before it. Scrum exists to protect the developer. It explicitly says that estimates are inaccurate by their nature (estimating in story points, never time), estimating is hard and needs the intelligence of the team (planning poker), and the bigger the estimate the less likely it is to be accurate (fibonacci-ish estimate sizing). It allows developers to hide important tech debt removal inside stories by making stories explicitly stated in feature terms, and not in terms of items that a product owner can deprioritize.

After all, when you vaccinate them for other diseases, do you tell them exactly what the vaccines do, what diseases they prevent, or how they work?  If you don't tell them they've been vaccinated against X # of HPV strains, they wouldn't make a corresponding change of risk behaviors.Also, pay attention to which vaccine series you purchase (some protect against as few as two strains), and make sure the entire series is applied (gener"	DrScump	4.8038163	1.3895338	comment	4.0	15.0	1484958666	-14.456753

The most convincing approach to me would be a single blind experiment to hire two software development teams and have them build to the same set of requirements in two different ways. But then it is hard to know whether you are really comparing the method of software development or the quality of the software teams. So two software teams isn't enough to get a statistically valid inference. You can see that, given software development rates, this could become a very expensive experiment.Last point.

Planning for releases tends to be a really big deal, the pressure to make promises of both functionality and delivery dates is very strong.Also, Agile methodologies tend to assume you are in close contact with the customer, who can tell you what they actually want and decide how things should work.

You plan 8-12 weeks at a time across all teams and invest heavily in planning for 2-3 days of that entire time period. The planning time is synced up for all dev teams so they can communicate and work out cross dependencies.The other perk here is that you’re goal is to commit to the 12 weeks and not every 2 weeks.

I too had a private office, and I recognize a lot of what you describe. While it was nice, it was not a very productive environment. Each release of new SW was enormous and typically took a year or more to get out. The developers had no real idea of how things worked in production. Lots of useless documentation was produced. Later on, RUP and tools like Rational Rose were introduced that made things worse. Basically, things worked out despite the process and tools, not thanks to them.In all my jobs since, I have worked in a more agile setting. By that I mean that the team is small (less than 10 people) and sits together with some sort of product owner. Not private offices	henrik_w	4.4023614	1.2636416	comment	4.0	17.0	1549702421	1.8623005

Noting down whether the estimation was correct or not, though, is important.The whole point is that a team is supposed to get more _predictable_ over time. They learn how to estimate better, and having a fixed ""box"" to fill is a very easy way to do so.So: Scrum is a ""scientific"" way to reach a sustainable pace (""scientific"" meaning: based on objective, repeated measurements).This is not to say that Kanban does not work.

You allow people to tell you what to work on, when to work on it, interrupt you, and generally walk all over you.  And you don't deserve any royalties right, because you aren't special?  Your fellow developers don't deserve higher pay or royalties, they aren't special either.Lets just see what happens when this mentality spreads.  Developers will get no choices and must all program uniformly.  Creative solutions must be approved by the board first.  All decisions are made by shareholders and executed by project managers.  You will be judged solely on your story point outputs in a perpetual 'sprint'.

I've seen (and been part of) hard core agile teams burning to the ground, and teams with no methodology be wildly successful. (And vice versa)Agile bothers me because it generally aims to commoditize developers, and yet the best places and teams I've worked on always were they opposite: it was about finding the best way for each individual to work, and designing processes around the rhythms around whatever industry they were working in, rather than assuming everything should fit into 2 week sprints.	overgard	4.394133	1.2640086	comment	4.0	12.0	1527275674	-13.760914

It's about understanding the tradeoffs and how the delivery date will be affected.Second, how well can you predict what you can achieve as a developer in one day vs one hundred days? The estimate for the former is more reliable. Likewise the estimate of what you can achieve is more reliable in a one week sprint than a two week sprint. Being able to break fully deployable commits into smaller chunks (up to three days coding time) is a skill that gets better with practice.

I have an idea how we can reframe the debate to this effect.When software engineers plan and write software, they actually build two things - the product itself and the infrastructure/tooling for it. From the project and product management perspective, the focus is on the first and the latter is often neglected as unimportant (and waste of time).	js8	4.3874846	1.2654557	comment	4.0	17.0	1698560120	-13.780141

In other words, story points helped to make sure that if they wanted changes, and more stuff, then they would need to pay for it.You do not have this balance within a company, because there is constant pressure to increase velocity. This is why there is so much burnout within the industry. There is constant pressure to do more and to do it faster.To the OP's point, there are so many scam Agile coaches out there, who can't write a fizzbuzz function. I've met many of them.

It helps us to think about breaking up our tasks, and how tasks can be broken up. At the end of the sprint, we get to take a bit of a breath, and prepare for more upcoming work.Kanban style means that it's just a marathon. There's no time to stop and take a breath, there's no time to celebrate anything that gets done, because the workstream is just infinite instead of divided.That's my two cents, anyway.	mydriasis	4.4037805	1.2536937	comment	4.0	14.0	1689948196	9.7150755

Just because they allow the public to access it, doesn't mean the public should have a right to re-use it.People argue that the data is public.  I say that's not the issue.  While the data itself might be available elsewhere, it is raiding the _collection_ of it that is being argued, not that 'public' data is 'private'.The _value_ that LinkedIn adds is that they've built the structure to collect and maintain the data. They are _not_ asking the court to prohibit anyone from collecting the same data on their own, at their own expense.

Because the developer toolchain switched to Objective C 2.0 with garbage collection enabled, the OS was unusable for development for months at a time.Development took twice as long as planned, the release was fairly bloated, and required 2 or 3 updates in the first month or two.When Craig took over he introduced a sprint model so that there were periodic relatively stable releases.  If something wasn't ready and there were still sprints left, you could push it back.But it sounds like there has been milestone creep causing those sprints to either become more heavy or less missable.  And I'm guessing the consequences for missing a sprint are more career limiting than they were when the methodology was still new.It's lik	CoolGuySteve	4.4014826	1.2600322	comment	4.0	20.0	1574345212	10.382315

And that usually means O(n) as it is perfectly acceptable for a single call... But when an O(n) calls another O(n) is where you run into trouble.But at the beginning, nobody was planning for that call to be fast - implicit requirements lead it that way.In some ways, being able to identify and detect resource usage is what is nice about waterfall. Identification of critical API calls and respective timings would be integral to continue building the GUI elements. But we all know how waterfall is poo-pooed these days.	crankylinuxuser	4.3930917	1.2652985	comment	4.0	18.0	1575907788	-13.763042

And besides, even Scrum doesn’t require a delivered product each sprint. Just an updated status and increment completed.If I’m building a new server and client architected system, the early sprints may be getting certain design details down. More documentation than code. Later on, I may have sprints that only establish the handshake between client and server and no real functionality. The point is taking milestones (big chunks of work) down to smaller chunks of work that can establish a clearer goal set for the near future.And that isn’t even unique to Scrum. If you don’t establish small iterative goals it becomes difficult to measure progress. Saying, “We can’t measure su	Jtsummers	4.404701	1.2590234	comment	4.0	12.0	1564843973	-13.747403

Then spend the next two weeks implementing that plan. Software development almost never works out so neatly.What really happens is that you have a set of requirements and an idea of how you are going to implement the feature. You start working on it, maybe you discover that there is a whole area of code that needs updating in order to allow for your feature to be implemented. This adds on another week of work required.In a common-sense based development team, what usually happens is the developer has a quick work with the project manager and maybe other devs who need to be involved and says ""Hey, I've found out that we need another week"	theworld572	4.3958726	1.2620859	comment	4.0	29.0	1564846494	-13.743201

It seems to nearly universally lead to dev whiplash, poor product architecture and large amounts of technical debt.Many companies also seem to end up employing tens of people who don't actually have any role at the company-- they just show up an 'moderate' these 'ritual' meetings.

I personally hate sprints - they tend to be inflexible and sometimes force you to make the wrong compromises.  They are typically filled with many disparate tasks that often require you to context switch back and forth repeatedly.  If you under estimate the time some tasks take, the numbers paint you as a weak performer.  Those who game the system by over estimating every task are viewed as super achievers, even if their actual value contribution is far lower.  I think if you take away the metrics aspect of sprints, it actually becomes more useful.	xedrac	4.412364	1.2613848	comment	4.0	29.0	1640414360	6.593052

Architect/engineering lead - takes care of whether the thing is technically feasible, what technologies are used and what technical trade-offs are made.And there was a vast literature and discussion about how these three sides affect the result of the project, and how to solve these problems.Unfortunately, Scrum, renaming everything, acts as if the history of project management doesn't exist.

Back in the bad old days you'd have three people working on parts of the system for 6 months and plan to snap them together in 2 weeks and it would take more like another 6 months.Agile methods are also useful.  If you can't plan 2 weeks of work you can probably not plan 6 months.When agile methods harden into branded processes and where there is no consensus on the ground rules by the team it gets painful.  The underlying problem is often a lack of trust and respect.  In an agile situation people will stick to rigid rules (never extend the sprint, we do all our planning in 4 hours, etc.) because they feel they'll lose what little control they have otherwise.  In a non-agile situation people can often avoid each other for months and have the situati	PaulHoule	4.3914113	1.2589359	comment	5.0	77.0	1484754589	-13.75918

That's great but after a couple of days work, it turns out that 2 years ago Joe Bloggs added some complex verification algorithm no one understands to a stored procedure, oh which contains about 30 other input fields, and so is going to take an extra week to untangle.

I like them so long as the goals are extremly well defined and managed. Too many teams though forget the agile aspect of agile development.

The fundamental problem that drives most agile failures isn't in the team's execution, it's in the business' expectations. One side is signed up for incremental delivery, and one side is set up for a fixed scope and deadline and the result is misery. I think this article makes a lot of good points. Scrum isn't the complete answer, but it's a big step in an organizational transformation.

Linkedin is a great resource when used as a kind of living resume, but it falls pretty flat as a social network because it doesn't really fill any niche that other social media platforms don't.That said, there is definitely a slimy underbelly of Linkedin that's filled with narcissists and braggadocios who spin self-aggrandizing tall tales. They're mostly harmless, but I could imagine it devolving into something more toxic if it's left unchecked, the way that many other social media platforms have.There's a great twitter account @StateOfLinkedin that catalogs the most ridiculous of the blow-hards that's pretty entertaining"	jzymbaluk	4.906475	1.889477	comment	5.0	18.0	1565358475	-4.461743

People who've been at the trenches long enough seem to be waking up to this fact, and we must be careful to not overreact on our own.Agile seems great when both you and the customer have zero idea what you're doing, but not all projects are creating something completely new.

It occasionally produces a low-quality contact or recruiter spam. That's about it. My peers don't keep theirs up to date, my employers don't use it as a major hiring source, I don't trust endorsements there as meaningful or predictive.

I had hoped this would fly, since the company talked a big game about being agile.But no dice.

Plus, 50% of software developers (UX, product management, QA, SRE, stakeholders, etc.) are worse than average: a process that top quartile people struggle to make work well, sometimes even under the most favourable of circumstances, is less valuable when broadly applied across the	bartread	4.3938875	1.2647648	comment	5.0	16.0	1690110943	-13.749394

Scrum doesn't exist to make developer's lives easier. In my experience as a SWE in a scrum team, devs have basically always felt like our time is being wasted in meetings.Scrum, imo, exists so that management and business stakeholders can have an understanding of how efforts are being allocated and give feedback on it. There's still plenty of ways this can go wrong, and I agree with others that the short sprint cycles of 1-2 weeks lead to the extra overhead of too many ceremonies, but I think for the average business stakeholder it probably gives a better result than waterfall.	idkyall	4.387367	1.2644897	comment	5.0	22.0	1693413873	-13.7423725

Sometimes a problem and the solution are well-understood, and in these cases scrum works as a decent project management approach.

This is generally a positive outcome for people/companies turning web text and HTML into structured data, e.g. tools like Puppeteer and Scrapy can be used more freely on sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Reddit. Now, you might still get into trouble if you re-publish that data, but you can, at least, safely use the data ”internally”, and the act of scraping/crawling (politely) is not, per se, something unlawful.	pixelmonkey	4.9029593	1.8874724	comment	7.0	51.0	1570988490	-4.5018063

If you question it, it's because you don't understand it; if it yields bad results, it's because you did it wrong; if it doesn't fit the dynamics of the rest of the company, it's because the company is immature.

They usually get some percentage of your starting salary, so let's say they make 15k if your offer is 100k (making up these numbers, but probably in the ballpark. Also, they only get paid if you stick around for at least a few months). If your offer is for 120k, they might make 3k more, so they have some incentive to get you a higher salary, but really, their incentive is to close as many deals as possible. Better to close two deals for 15k each then to drag out one deal for 18k.As long as you understan	chadash	4.945838	1.8845572	comment	8.0	46.0	1638279477	-4.5246406

Or at least not the bogeyman it's made out to be.The real danger is that the project would just be managed badly, independent of professed approach.

Not only did I not get a single response to my messages, I got one angry response from a Recruiting Director asking me to buzz off and stop pinging people at her company.Does anyone find LinkedIn useful?  The importance some people put on having an updated LinkedIn profile with updated contact lists seems outrageously disproportional to the actual value the site provides.  It seems odd, too.

They don't even know because it's their job and they convinced themselves of its usefulness.It can still be evaluated on the merits but IMO this greatly pollutes the speed at which software devs as a broadly conceived community can come to consensus understanding of this.Also I think the comparison to lean manufacturing has always been very shallow.

What we need more of is common sense.	jongjong	4.3835244	1.2697097	comment	10.0	51.0	1693376923	-13.780328

To break down stories into consistently stress-free achievable stories, rather than big risky ones filled with unknowns.I'm not saying this was a good workplace, it doesn't sound like it at all. But to me, it sounds like the devs who you think gamed the system, were mostly behaving the way scrum is meant to incentivize. Happy, stress-free development that delivers consistently improving software.(Minimum point totals per week leading to inflated point values is terrible management, though.)	crazygringo	4.4011292	1.2607815	comment	10.0	44.0	1693682403	-13.722379

We no longer have drawn out sprint planning meetings where we discuss requirements of features that we never end up working on in that sprint. We don’t waste time debating complexity of features. Everything is now just ad hoc. When we need more requirements definitions, we pull the necessary members of the team together and discuss it. When we see that there needs to be architectual discussions and high level planning, we do it immediately when we recognize the need for it. The idea that you can try and commit to or even forecast how much can be completed for a period of time is pretty absurd. Just identify the minimum requirements of what needs to be done and do it.

Electronics require pretty specific requirements up front before you design and order boards, obviously mechanical tooling can be even more expensive.But... I think there are lots of ways to do quick experiments and tighten up the feedback look even with robotics or electronics.  Breadboards and development kits can be used as initial electronics prototypes.  3d prints help test a mechanical concept.  Within each phase of the design more experiments can be done.  But ultimately the project is probably more waterfall than agile!	roland35	4.385777	1.2674956	comment	10.0	91.0	1568809092	-13.768207

Then Agile comes along and offers the appearance of making it easy to score and and measure team and individual effectiveness. Sure it's ""supposed"" to be for the team to measure their own effectiveness and empower people to work more productively, but for folks in management roles, the opportunity to 'score' engineers based on Agile metrics is too attractive.Once it becomes just a way to figure out who's not moving fast enough, or ""failing to meet their commitments"", of course people will hate it.

I understand why managers like it because it at least lends some structure and predictability to what is an inherently unpredictable enterprise.But the author's criticisms of the incentives of Scrum are on point I think. Because the stories are always articulated in terms of user facing features they encourage developers to hack things together in the most expedient way possible and completely fail to capture the need to address cross cutting concerns, serious consideration of architecture, and refactoring.This is how you can get two years into a project and have managers and clients that think that things are going well when the actual code is an increasingly unmaintai	cageface	4.3889794	1.2634009	comment	11.0	184.0	1470655182	10.77521

But what Scrum seems to add on top of the agile manifesto seems to be mainly dogma.I like the term ""just-in-time process"". A team should have only the processes in exactly the amounts that provide value to the team, and no more. If a daily standup is found to waste people's time, don't do it, or do it less often.

I put leading in quotes because there’s only so much leading one can do if everyone else knows more about the product due to the inherent transitory nature of the scrum master role.

I’d wager a majority of HN readers can’t help but to seek out understanding of the business, where this piece fits, what it interacts with. For us, specifying everything upfront is useless.

Airframes probably can't be modified like that. So it follows that, within a waterfall project, the flight software shouldn't be developed agile either.Beyond that, I don't think safety critical systems should be  produced code first.

I'm a performance engineer working closely with two teams. One doing Agile and the other basing on wikis and Adhoc in-person whiteboard discussions.
I find the non agile team more productive, efficient and dare I say happy.
The Agile based team makes me sit in on their daily scrum meetings. Although every one uses it to sync up on their dependancies, it just drags for an hour almost every day. I can visibly tell the devs walking out of the room spend more time worrying about ""velocity"" and ""organisation of work"" than the money making work that needs to be done.

Their very short nature forces participants to construct tasks that are easier to estimate and therefore complete on time with a higher probability.This certainly adds overhead to an idealised scenario where people take the shortest reasonble route often enough and that is the tradeoff. Plus: people actually seldomly take the optimum routes in the first place.Nobody has to like it, this is probably not the best method and maybe it's not even good.

The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the ""product owner"" concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives ""them"" total control over my workday while I have no idea what ""they"" are doing the whole day. 
Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I'm much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning.

The company hired a lot of project and program managers who were pulling everyone into everyone meeting.I presented the number of hours (meetings multiplied by engineering participants) to our VP and he insisted I must be wrong. He insisted there was no possible way we could be spending that much time doing Scrum things and that I must be exaggerating or lying. He then fell back to a lecture about how Scrum is an industry standard and how it's more efficient than alternatives.Really opened my eyes to the disconnect between Scrum mythology and Scrum in practice. The amount of time lost to doing Scrum things was so out of control that some people had fewer than 3-4 hours per day to actually work.Of cours	Aurornis	4.394141	1.2634075	comment	27.0	191.0	1705337354	-13.7372265
32001964	Two points to highlight from this ar	Two points to highlight from this article:1. LinkedIn is an absolute godsend for bad guys, allowing easy targeting of everyone in the company with spear phishing emails and texts. I know many security professionals no longer use their real name, and don't list the real name of their company, because they know it's such a great hacking vector. Not sure what/whether LinkedIn can do anything about this.2. I wish there were more information about what the vulnerability was in the PDF in the first place. I think a lot of people would be wary of downloading a PDF from a stranger, but not from someone who you had multiple interview rounds with and who offered you a job.	hn_throwaway_99	4.916865	1.8871481	comment	27.0	219.0	1657119514	-4.463274

Basically, we think that LinkedIn profiles don't do a good job of showing engineering skill (especially for self-taught people or people from non-traditional backgrounds). I'm excited to just build better support for showing side projects and GitHub contributions. LinkedIn profiles have become the default engineering resume (despite the fact that most engineers are not particularly happy with their LinkedIn profile). But there's lock-in. I hope that we have enough scale to be able to chip away at this.	ammon	4.9083614	1.8885212	comment	29.0	148.0	1590211114	-4.4933033
