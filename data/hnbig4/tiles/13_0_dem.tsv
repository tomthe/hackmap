What do I name that class? ""card-sub-text"", ""card-sub-title""?

It'll still lead to everything looking the same, then people will probably ditch it and go back to really minimalist styles like HN to look cool again.	globular-toast	9.823164	-8.72047	comment	3.0	12.0	1706263311	-15.580121

It works against the idea that you mark up areas of your code with descriptive labels like ""header"" and then put the code describing how the header should appear in another easily-editable file, and instead encourages you to use generic style descriptors to describe how the header area of your site should appear in the HTML itself. This is how we built web sites before CSS was widely adopted and, though it was ""easier"" to do things like `<p color=""#999999"">` in HTML 3 rather than separate the code from the appearance markup, it was generally considered to be a really bad idea.

If so, then the div becomes <div class='divxyz-default'>.

It's not the revolutionary upgrade I was hoping for, but it's nice evolutionary step in the right direction. It's quite intuitive, but it doesn't get rid of most of the frustrations that come from doing layouts, as those come from the design of CSS itself. `@apply` makes the upgrade worth it though, it's easy to make custom classes from the Tailwind elements.The one thing I don't like is that the culture around Tailwind seems a lot more proprietary, like you're getting three quarters of a product that you need to buy the rest of, whereas Bootstrap felt like you got everything you could ever need for free.

Largely a backend dev who does frontend as required, including on side projects.I switched to TailwindCSS a long time ago and I have zero regrets. Its so awesome I can switch to a project that is 2 years old, and make a quick layout UI change without having to look at old CSS files to find classes etc. I also can just find a tailwind class name and apply lots of cool stuff that I've normally found difficult to do via ""pure"" CSS files.But I also feel that this is likely to be a thing that half prefer A, and half prefer B, and there is nothing wrong with either. In this thread is likely to be a 50/50 split between both camps, with different ""ideologies"" on how the front end should be done.As the author of this article says - give it a go.

Personally I find it lets me build and maintain decent UI layouts with minimum fuss.

Honestly I have never felt so productive when it comes to designing pages.There is however one thing that prevents me from using it for everything and I'm curious if anyone knows a solution for this. If I am pulling a chunk of rich text from a CMS/backend/whatever, how can I style this?I tend to use Django for my backend, so in my template files I just put in a chunk like <div class=""container"">{{ body }}</div>. If that chunk has h2,p, etc. none of those are getting styled.In normal css I could just define what those h2, p, etc look like under a specific class.

Still not enough? `p-3`. More? `p-4`. I don't have to think and do math in my head like 0.25rem, 0.5rem, 1rem,... and IMHO, it's a big enough win for me to keep using Tailwind CSS.The features that were introduced in recent versions are just about supporting more CSS features to be more complete and not about feature-bloat."	thangngoc89	9.820783	-8.724747	comment	4.0	19.0	1666451706	-15.578143

Don't worry about it, just use ""p-4, p-6, etc."". Thinking in these terms becomes really powerful.Another great thing as that you just simply don't have to think about what to name things!

If I'm maintaining a project, I really do not want to spend my time learning some random DSL made up of obscure class names with abbreviated letters and numbers just to change the padding on a div. The component based approach is infinitely more maintainable. Things like Tailwind are fine for quickly prototyping something if you can't be bothered with design or styling at the time. But long term they are a maintenance nightmare.	aphextron	9.828039	-8.71581	comment	4.0	18.0	1615460333	-15.581071

Sure, the Tailwind utility classes are shorter, but the abstraction doesn't simplify anything. It's just some set of aliases you'll need to have memorized, and it's just moving the one-off combining of styles from the inline style property to the class property. It seems like something built to superficially follow the common wisdom of avoiding overusing inline styles.I want to echo the author's recommendation of styled-jsx.

This pays off hugely for large [enterprise] projects.In a million-line codebase, you can add and remove classes from a specific element with 100% confidence that you are not breaking anything else. With class-based styles, even when using theme variables, there is always the chance you end up breaking something at a distance by adding a property to an existing class, changing a shared value, renaming a selector or changing it's precedence.If you find yourself in this environment where dozens of people are making changes concurrently, and these issues are a daily occurrence, naturally you'	ricardobeat	9.827887	-8.716895	comment	4.0	20.0	1615463096	-15.581152

I think that more projects in Tailwind might mean less space for skilled CSS people.I believe that Tailwind is a trap for people that don't like CSS, because if they one day come to a project with regular CSS there will be a lot of unlearning before they will start working at full-pace.I might be biased because I love CSS and I find it the easiest thing in web-dev, especially now - without IE in the way and with flexbox + grid fellas, not to mention components.

It seems like for the best experience, you either buy Tailwind UI to use with a tailwind project for anything except the most basic UIs, reimplement the Tailwind UI components yourself, or have a weird mix of css-in-js and Tailwind CSS. Although I love the idea of HTML-native inputs all the way through, I tend to immediately run into issues where using a native interface instead of a JS-based implementation harms the user experience.Props to the team though - I feel like this is something I'll try out for a marketing site.	gunshowmo	9.85825	-8.697061	comment	4.0	19.0	1639077629	-15.571225

It also unifies some base level design decisions like spacing and colors, which developers would have to rely on ""best practices"" otherwise, which don't necessarily get strictly enforced.""I'm not sure how Tailwind works, but any CSS that's built at runtime and JS and inserted into the DOM dynamically should be avoided, and is an example of favoring developer experience over end user experience.""- You are right, looks like you are not sure how Tailwind works.

But they clutter your code, mix semantics with presentation, and are a pain in the ass when it comes to code reuse. The cascade part of CSS is, believe it or not, actually useful for code reuse. Need to change a font deep in some nested component? Not a problem with CSS. Tailwind, you're fucked. You'll need to modify each component layer to pass down a class prop.

Seems like you end up with walls of classes because you don’t name your compositions, and thus your design system doesn’t actually live anywhere.

26786313	Tailwind is the weirdest thing I've 	"Tailwind is the weirdest thing I've ever ran across. It's basically inline CSS.Personally, I write CSS this way:1. Select based on cascaded semantic HTML elements;
2. Don't repeat yourself;
3. No unnecessary classnames;
4. No style-descriptions in classnames.Only when you have troubles selecting an element based on its position in your DOM you should choose a classname. It should not be "".text-gray-500"" (like Tailwind does) but it should be ""p.author-role"".In my case the classname is semantically descriptive whereas Tailwind is not. In my case you just need to update the CSS and in the case of Tailwind you need to change your HTML and then probably also create a new CSS class.But still, ideally, you'd simply select it like this:The author name:    figure.author figcaption h5 { ... }

A big problem with CSS is that you end up making overrides no matter how composable you make the classes. And some simple things (e.g. responsiveness) are unintuitive and / or annoying to do in CSS. Hence Tailwind's ""CSS-in-HTML"" mini classes. But that doesn't fill the core purpose of CSS, bigger general-purpose classes to avoid repetition. Combine the two (general classes + mini classes for slight case-by-case fixes) and you get the best CSS experience I've seen so far (at least I think, I haven't tried it yet)."	armchairhacker	9.824691	-8.720369	comment	8.0	28.0	1627637278	-15.579767

The point of Tailwind is to give everyone a common vernacular of CSS phrases so that I can bust out something like ""p-2 m-2 border-red"" super fast and still be writing code which is immediately comprehensible to everyone else on my team.

I used CSS way before Tailwind was a thing and in hindsight I created a lot of utility classes that resembled a weakly-structured, somewhat incomplete version of Tailwind.It might be a bit verbose, it might be easy to abuse but it works damn well.

Extracting repeated compositions of utility classes into reusable components or named classes is exactly how I use other CSS frameworks such as bootstrap or foundation.

It seriously makes CSS significantly easier to maintain, dramatically reduces your CSS build size, and is really good for teams if you're trying to use consistent CSS throughout your UIs. You also don't need to go back and forth between CSS file and HTML file.If you're on the fence, try it out. I think it's the future of writing CSS.	65	9.823762	-8.721578	comment	21.0	135.0	1654868501	-15.578014

I’m almost certainly in the wrong, considering how popular this library seems to be getting, but holy heck that looks like a tedious mess to work with. It’s like you have to learn every raw CSS selector, and then also learned how it’s represented in Tailwind, and then scatter that all over your markup.	rco8786	9.823771	-8.714475	comment	23.0	137.0	1654862334	-15.57829

33789859	I hate Tailwind with the passion of 	I hate Tailwind with the passion of a million suns. It's loved by novices and those who don't know what they're doing, almost exclusively. They claim they know CSS, but will fail after any casual test.The best arguments against it:1. Spamming utility classes causes horrible git commits, git history, git difference checks;2. Conflicting utility classes aren't clear, and sometimes the order cannot be trusted;3. Replacing `p-4` with `p-4` will require you to replace its occurrence all over your app, sometimes affecting thousands of matches. And since there is no context to it, it'll be hard to JUST replace them where you would want them to.Vanilla CSS using `:root` declaration, a fixed base size (using `rem` and `em`), CSS variables and `calc()` are SO powerful.In almost every single use case	734129837261	9.82707	-8.718307	comment	26.0	166.0	1669740368	-15.580604
