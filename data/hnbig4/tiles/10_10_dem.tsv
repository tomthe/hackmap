The Apple Watch is designed as a companion device to an iPhone. Much of its functionality relies upon the phone (e.g. displaying notifications from the phone, installing watch apps which pair with corresponding phone apps) -- it can't do much on its own.	duskwuff	6.1810207	4.0420675	comment	3.0	14.0	1665603446	-5.7323804

Quartz watches are superior in almost every metric: they cost less, tell better time, pack more features, and are far easier to repair. Yet it's mechanical watches that are the world's most sought-after, expensive timepieces.This is a fascinating point. When it comes to our hobbies, romanticism trumps pure utility, and I think that's a lovely thing.	lordleft	6.135185	4.0228252	comment	3.0	10.0	1666966440	4.319031

It is a very HARD sell when you buy the ring to also get the diamond. I ended up buying the ring online to pick it up, and I have wondered since then if they would have refused to sell me the ring if I tried to buy it in store without a diamond.- I bought the moissanite online. It was nice seeing a linear increase in price on size versus an exponential price difference.- When I took the moissanite to a jewelry store to get it mounted, the ""fake"" diamond detector actually said the moissanite was a diamond!

Why would I wear a watch when I have a phone with me 24/7?!  Outside of niche applications like running, I'll always be completely befuddled by the success of smartwatches.  Watches just don't have a place in my world model anymore.VR falls into a similar category.  I don't want it -- although I can envision limited applications for AR -- but it seems a lot of other people do.  Sometimes we have to just admit that our perceptions and prejudices are out of line with the reality of the marketplace.	CamperBob2	6.19072	4.044229	comment	3.0	10.0	1680808028	-5.829159

The watch should make it so I can go on a run and leave my phone at home, but omitting features like this make it a lot more difficult to fill that role.The lifetime of a $350+++ Fitbit/notification screen is limited.

We talked about this extensively, and considered both lab gems and corundum gems (ruby/sapphire).We went through over a dozen jewelry stores, each of them pushing mined diamonds so hard that it angered us.  The eventual solution wasn't even that we found an amenable jewelry store.  We ended up obtaining a ring via a private transfer from a family member.  While the ring contains a mined diamond, it has quite a bit of sentimental value and didn't really put price pressure on the public market.

I find buttons unnecessarily hard to tap for instance (they should offer more vertical space), and the face is so sensitive that it routinely triggers unwanted actions.  It is really annoying to start something I want (like a timer) and notice some time later that I somehow accidentally stopped the timer by hitting my watch on something.As far as 3rd parties, I have seen a general trend of apps gradually withdrawing their support for watchOS.

I've owned a Fossil Carlyle 5 smartwatch with WearOS and an Apple Watch 3, and Apple's lead is definitely on the software side of things. I actually really dislike the material build of the Apple watch. The screen is designed to expose as much of the surface area as possible to scuffs and scratches, while the body of the watch feels larger than any other smartwatch I've used. The Apple Watch got hotter than the Fossil, somehow, and the sensor bump is also much more pronounced.Anyways, it's not like this is up for debate anyhow. Ask any analyst who's watched the industry for the last decade, they'll still tell you that Apple's advantage is in the software world.

While I don't know, whether I want to play long Quake sessions on my watch, it shows that the Apple watch is a quite powerful compute device.

Basically any software released in the 90ies should run easily on the watch. Of course, due to the small screen size and the lack of a keyboard, a totally different UI would be needed, but if people were really free to experiment and distribute, a huge field of new software could be opened.	_ph_	6.173503	4.041835	comment	3.0	12.0	1668857706	-5.97574

Most of their sales were discounted old inventory, so usually they didn't get to charge $450 per unit sold.https://investorplace.com/2018/02/holiday-apple-watch-sales-..."	brlewis	6.178517	4.050319	comment	3.0	10.0	1547764848	-5.8794165

On the lower end of the scale, a lot of mechanical watches will borrow design cues from Rolex (e.g., most dive watches will share similarities with the Submariner) and will fall far short of the quality of one.On the higher end, you quickly end up at multiples of the cost of an entry-level Rolex with very questionable additional value, quality or longevity.Rolex is really in a sweet spot in terms of value. They're virtually indestructible, tend to keep their (or even grow in) value and make a number of elegant, understated watches that are iconic.For example, if you want a dive watch, buy a Sub	ywnner_0001	6.1268764	4.030392	comment	3.0	10.0	1548670712	3.0299406

So depending on your maximum drawdown, you have to make a much smaller bet than what Kelly Criterion counsels.In fact that seems to be a general thing - Kelly Criterion is generally about maximizing geometric returns, but the volatility will kill you - it takes lot of betting to have high odds of being close to those theoretical retur	tunesmith	5.408362	4.321311	comment	3.0	12.0	1569968218	-14.813224

23236714	These tiny coin-cell-powered Bluetoo	These tiny coin-cell-powered Bluetooth tags are great for tracking your lost dog or stolen backpack, but they can do lots of other things, too!They can measure temperature, acceleration, and magnetic fields, so you can use them to detect when a door or window opens, whether a machine is vibrating, or even an object's orientation relative to magnetic north. All this can be done for years on a single battery charge and at a cost of pennies per sensor per day. If these devices become 10% smaller each year, it's easy to imagine them eventually becoming something like Smartdust [1].You could stick one on a treadmill or a weight machine to see how often it is used.

It was a $200 watch and they were going to swab the movement. That watch has emotional value, but I can't keep it running at 3x the replacement cost.Maybe someday I'll find a way to wear another mechanical, and get all the health tracking I appreciate otherwise.

My watch easily makes it a full 24 hours, I charge it in the mornings when I work from home, or in the evening when I'll be at the office the next day. Hers lasts about 18 hours right now, though I also suspect that the fact she drops it on the charger both in the morning and as soon as she gets home from work has impacted the battery life in her case.I wouldn't like it for camping or long hiking trips (not day hikes since I'd be able to charge it at some point easily enough), the Garmin's are definitely better for that if you want something for tracking your hike and heart rate.

Unlike a smartphone Pebble has a benefit of staying always with you, thus it is better than a smartphone for things like habit tracking, habit reversal therapy, time tracking. It reduces friction from having to reach out for your phone because it is always on your wrist and it has this great feature of quick actions. Basically you can assign any or all of its 4 buttons to launch an app or perform an action on long-press. This is invaluable.Another great feature is smart alarm. It works similarly to Sleep As Android and suchlike but you don't have to sleep with your smartphone on your bed.Other than that it can do notifications, quick replies, music player remote control, show you two days of calendar appoi	ivanb	6.2049246	4.020635	comment	3.0	10.0	1480577770	8.212199
13080131	So the thing surprising about this i	So the thing surprising about this is that Fitbit's stock just took a nosedive, their financials are questionable (but maybe the holidays will be good to them again) and they're acquiring a company in a market where there is a clear leader (Apple) but as whole, the market itself appears to have hit a peak or is in decline.Even if they got a steal the whole things seems like a bizarre move. At best they integrate Pebble into their lineup, get some good brain power in SV (they are HQed in MA I believe) and  build out their future products with Pebble's finely tuned developer ecosystem (their opensource SDK is amazing). At worst, they go down in flames and in the fire sale they fetch a little more for owning Pebble IP.	Negative1	6.1507444	4.0590487	comment	3.0	10.0	1480607209	8.574197

He could just say, this is dumb we aren't doing this. Google needs an exec team that understands products at the consumer level, not the engineering level and sees products as long living endeavors. The Apple Watch did not do great when it was released, but Apple kept making updates, kept improving it. They committed to the project and the vision and had the confidence to stick with it even if it lost money in its early days.	thrwn_frthr_awy	6.1733656	4.034773	comment	3.0	12.0	1601505352	2.5860717

On the latter point, for example, Diamond is still a believer in Clovis-First hypothesis, despite that having been discredited for so long that I learned about it in grade school decades ago.On the first point in particular: there's a general thesis of anthropology which is properly termed unilineal model (and in more colloquial terms, Civilization-style tech tree), which views civilizations as existing on a spectrum from less to more advanced.

All the fans wanted was that, iterated and improved upon.

As the founder, I can truly state that it was not our intention.We honestly thought that smartwatches were about to be a big thing for a lot of people and started scaling up. As I outlined in the post, we (poorly) tried to target a larger market segment and also scaled up our team. We were mostly right - smartwatches are objectively a major industry right now, but our strategy to do so was pretty bad. I don't think I would have changed anything, but looking back of course I see what would have been a more successful (but smaller) path.	erohead	6.1544037	4.0525928	comment	3.0	12.0	1649723167	8.441347

I’ve used their products pretty much exclusively for nearly 20 years (I’m an iOS/WatchOS dev and have used Logic to make music for 15 years) but I’ll never understand many of their decisions.	lostgame	6.1693096	4.04498	comment	3.0	11.0	1684680140	-5.983721

If the choice were Casio or nothing, I’d just stick with nothing. A time keeping device on my wrist solves no problems for me (except running, in which case the Garmin comes out). A Casio “gets the job done” in the same way a buggy whip still gets the job done: it’s a job that kinda doesn’t need doing anymore, at least for me.If there were a wrist-worn device that can track my runs, open my garage door, turn on the lights, remind me to water the neighbor’s plants tomorrow at noon, play me some music and...oh, what the hell, tell me the time, too...THEN we’d have something worth wearing on my wrist all day. Which is why I have an Apple Watch and not a Casio.	mikestew	6.146232	4.0324893	comment	3.0	10.0	1566865131	4.364941

It was an 8 mile loop with some good elevation gain -- took me maybe 4 hours. The Apple Watch died 3/4 of the way through the hike despite being fully charged that morning. The Charge HR has lasted 3 and 4 day trips to the Sierras with room to spare, and it's always capturing heart rate, whereas the Apple Watch is really only doing that when I tell it to.	sulam	6.230105	4.066956	comment	4.0	17.0	1473280406	5.048478

Up until the late 70s, watches were tools to keep you from being late.Since then, you've been able to get a cheap, reliable watch for next to nothing. Quartz movement, combined with mechanization of production, ensured that. The whole industry had to adapt to making watches themselves sort of an aesthetic statement, not a practical tool to keep you from being late.At this point, any watch costing more than $25 is itself an aesthetic piece. Part of that aesthetic is where and how it's made.

There is a defensible argument for not allowing mandatory binding arbitration for certain things.But eliminating the ability of parties to agree to a confidential settlement is a huge mistake.It will result in victims getting less money. An allegation of harassment, without further evidence, is not going to fare well in court. Yet the accused might be willing to pay a settlement to put the matter to rest and avoid negative publicity. By prohibiting them from getting confidentiality in exchange for payment, you have removed their largest incentive to pay the accuser.

Traditionally, these are quartz oscillators, crystals that vibrate at a specific predictable frequency—generally 32 kHz.Watch crystals run at 32[.768] kHz because you can divide with a binary counter by 2^16 and get 1 pps to drive the Lavet stepper driving the seconds hand.Watch crystals are also commonly used by MCUs for their RTC (real time, very low power clock), but never used to produce the main clock of a SoC or something like that. Mostly because that'd need an insanely high multiplication through a PLL (higher frequency multiplication ~ higher phase noise). Base clock crystals are typically 20-50 MHz.Quartz crystals used to be hermetically sealed.	blattimwind	6.1223583	3.960358	comment	4.0	49.0	1540931271	4.651691

If you don't value money in a logarithmic way then you shouldn't use the Kelly criterion.Personally I feel that my utility function is sublogarithmic. If I'm just spending on myself then beyond a certain point additional money makes me absolutely no happier. Note that the usual justification of progressive taxation also assumes sublogarithmic utility. So based on this we should be more conservative than Kelly.On the other hand, if I plan to give money to charity then my utility function is almost linear.

If you enable Wi-Fi debugging, you can actually ssh in to the smartwatch and poke around the file system.The UI story is a mess though. There's EFL, a C-based GUI layer of somewhat legendary status in Linux circles (it's derived from the Enlightenment window manager). It's plenty fast, as a smartwatch should be, but kind of a bastard to program for.Alternatively you can write HTML apps, but they run like sedated dogs on the smartwatch.Last I heard, Samsung was trying to add React Native into the mix.

The 4th corner has a timer - i use it for everything from ""the dog's out the back garden, i should remember to let her back in, in 5 mins"" to brewing a cuppa to reminding me to do something - the UI here is really good, i'm a mixture of ""hey siri, set a timer for 25 minutes"" vs. just tapping one of the pre-set timer"	CraigJPerry	6.193537	4.031322	comment	4.0	13.0	1614727758	4.453661

It's still rough around the edges, uploading new watchfaces takes some work, phone notifications aren't implemented yet, no case, etc.But if you're intrigued by the idea of hacking on ESP32s, WiFi, BLE and/or e-ink, as a wearable hackable dev device, Watchy can't be beat. It's a lot of fun. Think of it as a wifi/BLE-enabled Arduino on your wrist.	dandelany	6.1667714	4.041581	comment	4.0	20.0	1614730386	4.668855

Many mid-range android users own one simply because it’s what the company told them to buy and they “just wanted a phone” while low end android devices lack battery life.)
In the wearables market in the US, Garmin exclusively sells to hardcore fitness fans. They really are a niche company, (a very profitable niche, with high selling prices).

Its usefulness is also defined in social terms. It's an expensive novelty item, a status symbol, a conversation piece, an icebreaker, etc, then it's also a practical item. This one doesn't achieve these social functions by mechanical complications, a multitude of jewels or fine engravings by monk-like artisans, but by putting the product on the very forefront of modern technological development, something that would be hard to catch up on by more traditional watch manufacturers. It's also a contribution to the ever-ongoing competition between traditional mastery and modern inventiveness and the struggle for status. – That said, I love this product as a period piece.	masswerk	6.138353	4.028334	comment	4.0	18.0	1656299351	4.2457376

I have several very nice dress watches that I keep for sentimental reasons that I'm not able to wear because the manufacturer used one-off straps for them.

I really don't think they have.We need real technology that saves labour, like washing machines, dishwashers, sewage processing, electricity grids.I think satellites can provide services that join that club, by allowing decentralization through ubiquitous access to medium speed internet.Smart watches tend to provide information that really doesn't matter, like number of steps in a day. Yes there is the example of the heartbeat, but for most that is just informational also, plus other dedicated devices already existed.I think too much of new tech are just toys, hopefully this is just an interim stage and we are about to get to the real stuff again.	amiga_500	6.1794267	4.04154	comment	4.0	16.0	1597798066	4.4656835

There was certainly a renewed interest in mechanical watches at the time, a lot of it being driven by things like MaleFashionAdvice on Reddit.

Old Seiko mechanical chronographs like the 6139 could be had readily for less than a thousand dollars. I had a beautifully restored one I bought and sold for around $300. The same watch is worth at least three times that today.At that time, it was still possible to acquire steel Rolexes at ""modest"" prices.

31171345	So I really like mechanical watches 	So I really like mechanical watches but I've kind of lost interest because it's nigh-on impossible to buy anything new (unless you're a high net worth individual) and the secondary market is utterly insane.Example: Rolex Daytona in steel retails for ~$13,000. You can buy that from the store and immediately sell it on the secondary market for $30,000+. The Patel Phillippe Nautilus 5711A is similar ($25-30,000 retail, $75,000+ secondary).As it happens when the current Rolex Daytona came out a few years ago the market wasn't anywhere near as hot and the market was flooded with people flipping the old model for the new. I happened to buy one of the old Daytonas for $10,000. Last time I checked it sells on the secondary market for $35,000. It's nuts.For anyone who is interested in this, the pla	cletus	6.125674	4.031398	comment	4.0	15.0	1650998187	2.9937453

They’re less expensive and sharper-looking.After looking at the watches shown off in this article: I made the right call.

As an adult, the choice to agree or not agree to conditions of a private transaction seem to be a fundamental liberty. If people didn’t agree and it affected recruitment, then companies would respond accordingly. Also, without arbitration, conceivably that could result in a lower offered salary to offset the risk of litigation. Given that the vast majority of employees never care about suing, the higher salary is a better outcome most of the time. Banning forced arbitration is necessarily going to increase employee costs to a company, which means less money to pay people much in the same way higher health costs affect salaries as well.

Atmospheric CO2 has trace amounts of carbon-14 (~1 per 10^12 C atoms) and the resulting beta-decay-mode emissions can be easily easily detected.Practically, this means the methane fed into the chemical vapor deposition process has to be extracted from biogas (say, a chicken manure digester) or directly synthesized from air and hydrogen (Sabatier process).

All jewelry is like that.Jewelry prices, for reasons I don't entirely understand, are sort of like car values...once you drive it off the lot, so to speak, the price plummets.So when I got married I did not ask for a diamond, as I knew it was basically worthless -- except to the jeweler."

Therefore, although the diamond is the same, it no longer serves the same purpose.  So, the cheaper diamonds get, the less demand there is from prospective brides, even if only marginally.  This fuels further declines, although that is probably already happening due to better industrial diamonds.This takes time, of course.  But that also means it has a lot of momentum.

Incomplete.I wear a Garmin vivoactive HR watch that does a lot, but certainly not all that an Apple watch does; but it goes about a week on a charge.  One feature I like of smartwatches is the sleep tracking.  But with the Apple watch, wouldn't you need to charge it while you slept?

But when you can join a better in group, or add a new asset to the one you're in, it turns to love. Thus, I consider collectibles of all forms, a combination of social value plus a dash of scarcity mindset.

No link to the phone, cannot install Android on them most likely. So they are buying it purely for their experience making watches and not for their products.Also, I wonder how much Google will want to invest in devices that are not connected to their ecosystem and might neglect existing products which will simply dilute the brand. Could be a good thing for Fit though, as I don't see that as a growing business over time.	yalogin	6.178409	4.0495687	comment	7.0	21.0	1572281779	8.631932

Only posers who aren't really into cars but want to show off their wealth spend $120k on a car.For watches, the same thing happens: if you're wearing a watch less than $50k, it had better be under $500.

SiC has a greater index of refraction, which improves the properties of total-internal-reflection as well!

For most people, it has become mostly a fashion accessory first, a utility device second. Pebbles really don't look fashionable to most people, both on style, and on brand perception. People will put up with a bit of questionable styling if the brand signaling is good enough, but the reality is, the vast majority of people will not recognize a pebble, and instead will just see a not very stylish device on your wrist. As a fashion accessory, the pebble fails incredibly, and to build a scalable standalone watch company around watches which don't pass a	lesdeuxmagots	6.152092	4.05321	comment	8.0	33.0	1480570484	8.376438

Citizen Watch Company recently release the most accurate quartz watch ever, accurate to 1 second per year. Contrast that to the mechanical watches that Rolex—one of the best mechanical manufacturers—produces and the best they can do is an accuracy of about 1 second per day. Hundreds of times less accurate. Yikes! And then you can get into radio-controlled and GPS-controlled solar watches that you literally never have to set or change the battery. So neat!Mechanical watches are an emotional rather than rational technology, and hey if that's what you're into: mechanical watches and horse-drawn-buggies and gas lanterns then that's totally cool.	martinkraft	6.1493044	4.031542	comment	8.0	36.0	1628521725	4.462017

27454113	I wonder how professional gamblers a	I wonder how professional gamblers approach bet sizing. It seems to me that for most applications the Kelly Criterion is not the right choice. The utility of money is asymmetric; gaining $25000 is worse than not losing $25000. Relatedly, most actual gamblers want to ensure good returns while not going broke, so minimizing risk of ruin is often more important than maximizing return rate. Further complicating the matter is that in real life you don't know your actual probability of success, but you may have an estimation. And finally, though this is less commonly significant, your rate of return in a given game might depend on your the amount you bet.From what I've seen in the poker community, no one has really approached this type of bet sizing from a rigorous perspective beyond the relativ	zucker42	5.413144	4.319599	comment	9.0	36.0	1623277630	-14.834361

The engagement rings we got ourselves cost 18$ and were made from wood. After all, they only need to last a few months, or maybe 1-2 years, until the wedding.Regarding the wedding ring, I can understand slightly better how someone would put a bit more money into that, considering that you wear it for life. But there are so much better options than buying a shiny rock. Why not go to a goldsmith and pay 1000$ for a workshop where you forge your own rings? That will result in a lasting memory of a nice event, for a fraction of the cost, instead of throwing thousands of dollars out the window for a shiny rock that you simply buy at the store.

Had they added different wrist bands with smart tech in it, it would have gone even further.I don’t really think apple has a decade lead, what they do have is minimal innovation they’re competing with. AND more importantly, a brand and ecosystem. That being said if Samsung came out with a decent watch similar to pebble and bundled it with their phones I think they’d be outselling Apple.	lettergram	6.1561303	4.0512943	comment	10.0	78.0	1622244846	8.372973

Mechanical watches are so brilliantly unnecessary.Any Swatch or Casio keeps better time, and high-end contemporary Swiss watches are priced like small cars. But mechanical watches partake of what my friend John Clute calls the Tamagotchi Gesture. They're pointless in a peculiarly needful way; they're comforting precisely because they require tending.And vintage mechanical watches are among the very finest fossils of the pre-digital age. Each one is a miniature world unto itself, a tiny functioning mechanism, a congeries of minute and mysterious moving parts. Moving parts! And consequently these watches are, in a sense, alive. They have heartbeats. They seem to respond,"	staplung	6.1397476	4.0294127	comment	11.0	165.0	1657485742	4.2826276

Require by law that the arbitrator be picked by a judge, or be randomly assigned by the court system, who has presumably vetted the arbitrator.The main problem with these things is that the arbitrator is picked by the company, so they have a strong incentive to favor the company.

I've owned a handful of Garmin devices over the years and have never considered Fitbit. Now that Google owns them my initial reaction is that Fitbit is going to be in a very confusing state for the next year and their products will fall further behind.

Shiny carbon is shiny carbon to me. There’s no real logic in it. But given it’s a status symbol that derives its value from its rareness, I suppose it’s no different than a Luis Vutton or a Rolex. It’s not about the function, it’s about the fact that you can afford one.

How did we let this happen?For non-competes, NDAs should suffice.Arbitration should be a step towards legal rather than supplanting it.  Many times arbitration is better for both parties in terms of cost/time but when it isn't people shouldn't be signing away the right into forced arbitration to go further.	drawkbox	6.287588	3.5988817	comment	12.0	111.0	1512664951	-2.5789526

You can get a pretty durable one that'll last you nearly a lifetime for under $100, especially if you get a digital one since there's no moving parts to break.So why spend $5,000+ on one?  I mean, yeah you might want to get something fashionable and shiny, but that doesn't require a $5,000 purchase.I feel that the only reason to spend $5,000 on a watch is so that you can show off to other people that you can afford to piss away $5,000 on a watch, which is just silly.

For that to happen there would have to be a quantum leap in user interfaces and right now I don't see any technology on the horizon that could provide that leap. Watch screens are too small for anything but displaying simplistic stuff, let alone letting the user meaningfully and fluidly control the device.Voice interfaces have been tried for decades.

Maybe it's just knowing that you have this perpetually winding machine on your hand (in the case of ""automatic"" mechanical watches).Also knowing that the thing will last forever, take care of it and it will probably outlive you. Can't say that about an Apple Watch.If you want a good mechanical watch that won't break the bank I suggest picking up a Seiko SKX (though prices have been going up), a Vostok Amphibia (might be hard with the ukraine conflict) or a Timex Marlin."	_fat_santa	6.1456866	4.0331073	comment	14.0	101.0	1651678855	4.3041887
25527525	I'm loving my Apple Watch. I wasn't 	I'm loving my Apple Watch. I wasn't entirely sure yet what to think of the watch as a form factor, given that a phone can do everything it can and more. But there's three interesting aspects that have really added value for me.1) is health data, in a way a computer or phone just can't do. It tracks things like heartrate that a phone + heartrate strap is too convoluted for, for non-athletes. Plus it's all-day and quite accurate. My phone counts my steps in my pocket for example, but not when I'm at home or in the office. My watch can differentiate when I'm cycling to work with my phone in my jacket and detect exercise, whereas my phone may think I'm in a tram or on a motorised scooter.2) is gamification of exercise. Closing rings, notifications, nudges, vibrations, competitions. It all dema	IkmoIkmo	6.2299194	4.055182	comment	14.0	81.0	1608818848	-5.553292

I also have a very expensive top-of-the-range Garmin watch and even that just tells me the less useful sunrise and sunset, which makes me suspicious it's not as military as it markets itself as.I don't know if anyone knows an app that gives first-light and last-light for the phone, so I don't have to buy a new watch?	chrisseaton	6.1914563	4.0459423	comment	14.0	53.0	1609637494	4.8171515

The way you tell a lab made diamond from a “real” diamond? Purity.If it’s too pure it’s fake. There is this weird market where you want the purist diamond you can find, but not too pure. So you want some imperfections, just the perfect number of imperfections.Too many imperfections and it’s low quality.Too few imperfections and it’s worthless enough to grind to dust and use on consumable parts for power tools.The modern jewelry market is also substantially different than what past generations taught me jewelry was. To them, jewelry was meant to be a value store.

I don't need/want/like notifications on my wrist, but I really enjoy the activity and heart rate tracking of the Apple Watch.I have been reluctantly wearing a Samsung Withings watch that looks mechanical but is actually smart, but a mediocre compromise (you need to wear it higher up the wrist than I usually do, and I don't believe it gives accurate heart rate and activity measurements). 30 day battery life is pretty cool though.I may just start going back to my Vostok and Seiko watches full time at this point. (I don't like spending a lot of money on watches, anyone who is curious on getting into them should check out both brands as economical starters - the Vostok Amphibia has a storied history!)	steezy13	6.16969	4.0475154	comment	14.0	62.0	1702304871	4.4918637

Whilst I now would never buy a smartwatch, I think that theirs were by far the best. Slimline, with a great UI, and nice functionality, and also not locked into either mobile ecosystem.I'm not entirely sure what caused their death, but my personal view is that they tried to become too big, and I don't think the wearables market is really that valuable. They could have remained a small house which maintained a great product for a segment of the market that really appreciated it. I'm sure that's a simplistic view, and definitely ill-informed since I wasn't on the inside.I still think they are far better than the Apple Watch or any of the Android Wear devices I've seen.	gtf21	6.1466875	4.0575533	comment	14.0	70.0	1554592076	8.358377

It's incredibly well-made: I wear mine every day and after nine years together, it still looks better than the year-old iPhone in my pocket.  It's also understated--at least, my stainless steel, black-bezeled Sub Date is--and it doesn't scream ""expensive"" or ""showy"" like many watches on both ends of the price spectrum often do.There are a few advantages to owning a Rolex that may not be so obvious: For starters, it's quickly exchangeable for a high percentage of its value in cash in virtually any major city in the world.  Because you're always wearing it, that's $8,000+ in cash that you can have in short "	chrissnell	6.118076	4.0248194	comment	14.0	114.0	1485154672	2.8482416

Eventually texting became a thing, but at first it was just that freedom to make much looser plans and adjust them on the fly, which was really difficult before cell phones.With the watch, it feels the same, but about health. Knowing how much I walked around each day, how well I slept, what my heart rate was, etc. makes it a lot easier to understand what’s going on with my body and be more proactive about it.It’s also becoming a replacement for the cell phone.

It's very sturdy, relatively waterproof, the battery should last around a decade, and it even has a (terrible) LED for low light conditions!I started getting into watches last year, and the F-91W is a sort of rite of passage in watch circles. I've since bought a few expensive† ($1000+) watches for my collection, but I often find myself wearing the Casio. Yeah, I modded it and it has a bit of personal attachment, but it's not just that.

Has an alarm, stopwatch, and timer; all things missing from traditional wind ups. Interface is easy to use and discover.  The battery last almost forever.Now, if you're asking if it's aesthetically pleasing, that's a different story. But we were talking about design, right?EDIT: Wikipedia says they're only splash proof; I used to swim with mine but there you go.

OLED... you don't get that on any iPad.Apple Watch really has no competitor which matches 100%. On certain areas like fitness (Fitbit) or hiking (Garmin) there can be also some good and better alternatives but it does not match 100% of the features.I think there is always a choice except when looking at the Apple Watch.	therealmarv	6.175766	4.029868	comment	18.0	113.0	1692722147	-5.982307

A lot of people, me included, will never buy another Fitbit after having been burned.Their warranty only lasts one year, yet I've had to replace both Fitbit devices I've had twice within that one year. I'm now Fitbit-less because the latest, a Charge HR, failed for the third time, and it's out of that one year warranty.To give you an idea of how bad the Charge HR is, its charging plug attaches with metal prongs, but it plugs into a slim plastic housing that is only glued to the rest of the device. The obvious result is that the plastic housing eventually gets pulled off with the plug. That's how two of my three Charge HRs have died	CydeWeys	6.192607	4.0588536	comment	18.0	87.0	1485797706	8.520963

All of this so the price of man made diamonds doesn't bring down the price of the natural stones with it."	fgonzag	5.606181	3.7218306	comment	25.0	292.0	1527640347	-15.073859

I replace it with Fossil, now they quit.All I want is a simple watch with simple features that doesn't require charging every day. Their hybrid line with some sort of e-ink (like) display really is perfect to me.	INTPenis	6.1523423	4.053895	comment	25.0	191.0	1706337296	8.315664

She loves her ring, and it has held up extremely well. (She just had the band resized, absolutely no issues with the stones.)No one has ever thought it was anything other than a diamond ring, which includes several years of daily scrutiny from crazy New York City brides in her role as a bridal gown sales manager in a high-end atelier in Midtown Manhattan. Those who know about the stones think they're beautiful and love that there's a good alternative to diamond.I stand by everything I said in this essay, and would 100% recommend moissanite to anyone who is (or will soon be) in the jewelry market.	joshkaufman	5.6125298	3.7179708	comment	25.0	218.0	1479062051	-15.071812

My biggest mistake was including her in the decision.She described what she wanted exactly– nothing gaudy or ostentatious, just a singular, tasteful stone on a plain band. Couldn't be simpler, could it?Finding stones that met her criteria was easy. Some were natural diamonds, some lab grown, many moissanite. From the outset, she said the meaning of the ring was what was most important and that she didn't want to pick it out herself (after effectively picking it out herself). We'd talked about moissanite a lot over the years, and she'd approved of the idea, and the same with lab grown diamonds. We're college educated adults with backgrounds in the sciences, so we weren't on uneven footing with comprehension.When I showed h	washadjeffmad	5.614193	3.7169788	comment	25.0	176.0	1620139486	-15.079731

Furthermore, many comments here are about ""I want to see my kids grow up"". Now please, calculate the odds of:- you are in a terrible accident- there is no one around you to call an ambulance- you can’t call an ambulance yourself, because you are knocked out or can’t moveI think the odds for such an event are rather low. If you like smart watches, sure, go ahead and buy one. But for everybody who just wants to wear it because they are afraid: I don’t think it’s necessary for most people, unless you ride around alone in remote areas and are inexperienced or whatever.My point is: don’t buy because of fear if your risk profile is super incredibly low."
