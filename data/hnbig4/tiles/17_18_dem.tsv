My comment was largely based on this discussion:https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2173If you'd like to share a short summary of your thoughts, I'll update the article with your commentary.		ddevault
24845370	9.198045	9.039581	comment	3.0	11.0	1603263252	13.54431	I really don't think Meson and CMake should be mentioned in the same breath here. I would be glad to know what you think makes Meson so bad.		dxuh
